            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE VNPARTIALL READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT thou mayeſt enter with ſome light before thee into the enſuing Diſcourſe, I thought it convenient to let thee ſee the reaſon of the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the drift, or maine deſigne of this Booke. A <hi>Polititian,</hi> according to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive derivation, ſignifies a perſon rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endowed with thoſe noble qualities, whereby he is made capable to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the management of the greateſt affaires of a City, or Commonwealth: for, anciently the bounds of a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, or Republike, that is, the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a body politike, were uſually confined within the walls, or at leaſt the territory of one City. To ſuch a perſon a
<pb facs="tcp:103652:3"/>
               <hi>Cathechiſme</hi> is no ſit Booke, as being a Booke of Inſtructions for ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: But time hath kept the name, and changed the notion of a <hi>Polititian,</hi> as it hath of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> which anciently ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a <hi>King,</hi> without that odious caracter it puts us now in minde of. In theſe our dayes, when we heare a <hi>Polititian</hi> named in any language, we repreſent to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves a man ſo ignorant, that he knowes no other God, nor good, but his owne inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; a man that hath loſt the memory of the fundamentall articles of divine and humane Faith, and thereby ſtands in neede of a <hi>Cathechiſme,</hi> as much as any of thoſe, that for their age, or education, are preſented with Bookes of this nature for their inſtruction.</p>
            <p>As to the articles of divine Faith, he is taught, that there is a God, by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſuted to his capacity; and that this God, like an abſolute Prince, will be ſerved his owne way; and that we are to ſerve our ſelves of thoſe marks to finde out this way, which he hath ſet to lead us to it, and in it; and not thoſe we ſet to our ſelves, by our owne fancy, humour, and intereſt; or have beene ſet for us by others, whom we have no more reaſon to truſt then our ſelves.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:103652:3"/>
            <p>By looking upon all the viſible marks which have miſled ſo many into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold errours, in oppoſition to the onely true Catholick Apoſtolick Roman Faith, he ſhall finde them planted upon inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſupported by policy, and pointing out a way, which at length will be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to goe croſſe to the ancient high way not onely of divine Faith, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall felicity, but even of temporall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and humane policy. By peruſing the hiſtoricall part of this Booke, he ſhall clearly diſcover, that all our new preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reformations have ſo little ſignes of the right hand of God in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and progreſſe, that there will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare nothing in them, but the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of a left handed craft of a few ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-licentious cavilling <hi>Sophiſters,</hi> upheld by the power of ambitious and coveteous Princes, and impoſed upon, fearfull, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and godleſſe Subjects, without foreſight of the utter ruine, or great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance it was to bring upon the heads both of Princes and Subjects. The Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian is taught, that in caſe he have any pretence to divine Faith, he may as well pretend to it by the helpe of the Turks <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and Jewes <hi>Talmud,</hi> as by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to the new falſe Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:103652:4"/>and Interpretations; and that the principles of Proteſtancy, if they be drawne out at length, whither by rules of good conſequence they are proved to reach, will be of the ſame force to ſecure a mans conſcience brought up in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme,</hi> or <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> as in <hi>Lutheraniſme, Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> or any other Sect that goes under the name and notion of Proteſtancy, and furthermore open a wide gap for plaine <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> beſides the inclining of Princes to tyranny, and Subjects to rebellion.</p>
            <p>But in caſe it fall out, that our Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is beyond all hope to be induced to ſo much as to pretend to any matter of divine Faith, he ſhall finde inſtructions for humane faith, whereby to believe what is neceſſary to guide him in the way of temporall policy, which above all requires that by true, direct, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt dealings, he gaines ſo much credit to himſelfe, as to be believed by others, without which all his drifts and ſhifts will come to nothing. If we cannot bring him to the perfection of Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, yet our labour will not be loſt, if we can perſwade him, that the greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to worke his owne intereſt, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall honeſty; for, by ſeeking himſelfe in this way, he will be drawne to doe good
<pb facs="tcp:103652:4"/>to others, and withdrawne from thoſe miſchiefs and miſeries, wherewith Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians, following their ordinary courſe, are uſed to diſturbe and ruine the ſtate of mankinde.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning the Title and drift of the Booke. As to the ſtile, which ſome Proteſtant might wiſh were more gentle and courteous to his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, I muſt deale plainly with thee, and tell thee, that I am ſo naturally averſe from baſe and falſe cheating, which I diſcover ſo frequently and manifeſtly in all the Proteſtant Writers which I ever had occaſion to peruſe, that out of meere deteſtation of ſuch unworthy unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian proceeding, wherewith they delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and deſtroy ſo many ſoules, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> valued at the rate of his owne Bloud; that I can neither finde in my heart, nor finde any reaſon to court baſe knavery with reſpectfull ceremony. I have a good warrant from the example of ancient Fathers, who never tooke it for a point of charity, to treate hereticall Impoſtours with civility; neither could I ever finde they had to doe with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo ſhameleſſe in their forgeries, and ſenſeleſſe in their fopperies, as theſe monſters of men our laſt abortive age
<pb facs="tcp:103652:5"/>hath produced, Beſides, their writings are ſo full not of rallery, for want of wit, but of rayling and raging, for want of matter, and ſtore of malice, that it is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make them both knowe themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and be knowne to others; and it is juſtice, to pay them according to their deſerts. What is there to be read in <hi>Iewel, Horne, Fox, Barlow, Andrews, Morton, Potter,</hi> and <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and the reſt of that rable, but falſe and impudent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, malicious and bitter invectives againſt the Catholick Clergy, from the higheſt to the loweſt; perſons for birth, learning, vertue, and wiſdome, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving farre more reſpect, then any deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the <hi>Nags-head</hi> progeny.</p>
            <p>And albeit of late, miſery hath taught them more civility, then they had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to learne from their Anceſtors, yet even their laſt Authors, who thought it policy to condeſcend to ſome courteſy, cannot forbeare from traducing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of thoſe Prieſts that ſuffered in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and juſtifying the barbarous cruelty of her bloudy practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and notwithſtanding they grant the Pope to be the firſt Patriarch, and ſee, to their griefe, he is a powerfull Monarch, and conſequently deſerving, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb facs="tcp:103652:5"/>Biſhop and Prince, the reſpect of language, due in good breeding to thoſe reſpective qualities, yet they treate him and his Court in ſo villanous and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent termes, as if they were ſcoulding with their wives at home, or at cuffs in a Taverne with their <hi>Camerades.</hi> With much adoe we have brought them to confeſſe that the Pope is not Antichriſt, yet you may be ſure, they will eaſily bring themſelves to comply both in words and deeds better with Antichriſt himſelfe, if he chance to come in their time, then they have hitherto done with the Vicar of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> they will ſooner goe in pilgrimage to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to receive there the caracter of Antichriſt, then repaire to <hi>Rome</hi> for the ſupply of that other, which they undoubtedly want by the manifold and manifeſt defects of their fond and feigned Ordination at <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will detaine thee no longer in the entry of this worke, but wiſh thee as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee the truth, as I have beene ſolicitous to ſet it downe, without any diſguiſe, or deſigne of any thing but truth it ſelfe; knowing full well, that the God of truth is not ſerved his owne way, not onely by maintaining falſhood, but even by pretending to maintaine truth
<pb facs="tcp:103652:6"/>by forged arguments, or falſe hiſtories: neither can I hope that God ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with ſuch meanes, without whoſe concurrence, all my endeavours are of no effect; neither can I neede for the proofe of things ſo manifeſtly and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true, to ſuborne falſe witneſſes; and I ſhould moſt abſurdly contradict my owne principles, if I ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old it the duty of a Chriſtian, to ſupport by falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood true Chriſtianity, whereas I teach a <hi>Polititian,</hi> that it is againſt the very ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of meere humane policy, to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the compaſſing his ends by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths and impoſtures. Laſtly, I ſhould too fondly forget my ſelfe, by laying that imputation of falſe dealing upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Catholick Religion, whereof I ſo frequently condemne the Authors and Abettors of hereticall innovation; againſt whom I inveigh not through any bitterneſſe of paſſion towards their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but through a tender compaſſion of others, miſled by their lyes, and deceits, to their eternall perdition.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How men come to be Atheiſts; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be demonſtrated by reaſon, that there is a God, Providence, and another life?</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is a generation of men half witted, and not ſo much as half learned, but wholy vicious, who perſuade themſelves, that the <hi>ſoule</hi> is a blaſt of wind, the other life an imaginary <hi>Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> God a <hi>Chimaera</hi> which onely hath a being in the weake braines of ignorant people; <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> old wives tales, invented by States men to keepe the Subjects in awe, and pliable to the Prince his will, and pleaſure, by the dreadfull no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Eternity.</hi> The multitude (ſay they) muſt be cheated into its owne good, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into peace, and ſubjection; and no cheate is more plauſible, or leſſe ſuſpected, then that which men call <hi>Religion;</hi> provided, that ſuch as have leaſt, and governe the Commonwealth,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103652:9"/>counterfeit moſt, and ſeeme to be more zealous for the eſtabliſhment of the Church, then ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for themſelves, or their poſterity.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Men are not borne Atheiſts, neither are their mindes poſſeſſed of theſe extravagant fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on a ſuddaine; they fall by degrees, firſt from the love of God, and then from his knowledge. From the love of God they fall by every mortall ſinne; but from his knowledge, by a cuſtome and exceſſe of ſinning, and by drowning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſenſuall pleaſures, which divert their thoughts from the conſideration of ſpirituall things, and even from the beſt part of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, the <hi>ſoule.</hi> Notwithſtanding this diſtraction, and their being ſo bewitched, and beſotted with ſenſe, now and then they feele a certaine remor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and guilt of conſcience; which remorſe, and guilt of conſcience ſtrikes them into a terrour, or feare of divine juſtice; this feare degenerates into deſpaire of mercy: feare of juſtice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of mercy doe ſo trouble their ſoules, and underſtandings, that they recurre to the will to be eaſed, which endeavoureth to helpe them with a fond wiſh, or deſire, that no ſuch thing there were as God, Providence, and another world: this deſire creates a fancy like unto it ſelfe, and that without any difficulty, becauſe men are apt to ſoothe themſelves with fancying what they deſire; and ſuch a fancy transformed into a reall perſuaſion, is that which we call <hi>Atheiſme:</hi> whereof the ſeed is <hi>vice;</hi> remorſe, and guilt of conſcience, the <hi>diſpoſitions;</hi> deſpaire of mercy, the <hi>matter;</hi> a fond and perverſe will, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103652:9"/>
                  <hi>agent;</hi> a wiſh of Gods impoſſibility, the <hi>action;</hi> and the <hi>forme,</hi> a fantaſticall opinion of his owne exiſtence. Whereby it appeares, that Atheiſme is no worke of a ſound judgement, but of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved will, guided not by reaſon, but ſeduced by paſſion. Atheiſts in denying God, Providence, and the next life, judge not by the underſtanding, but by the will, not by reaſon, but by inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they believe that God doth not exiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wiſh he were impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Seeing therefore I have to doe with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that meaſure the poſſibility, or impoſſibility of things by wiſhes, and inclinations, I have thought of an argument ſutable to their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, waving other convincing, and ordinary demonſtrations of Gods exiſtence, grounded upon a <hi>ſeries</hi> of cauſes, and effects, and upon the diſpoſition, beauty, and order of this great <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</hi> I intend therefore to prove the poſſibility of God, by a wiſh, or deſire of his exiſtence; againſt which method Atheiſts can have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, becauſe it is their owne, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference onely, that my wiſh, or deſire ſhall follow reaſon, whereas theirs goes before it, or rather againſt it; becauſe they give the will not onely the precedence, but alſo turne it in oppoſition to reaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4 To demonſtrate that God is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is to demonſtrate his exiſtence; becauſe if he can be, he is; for, none but himſelfe can withſtand his being, as his poſſibility of being is from none but himſelfe. Now, I prove that he is not impoſſible. The object of a wiſh, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103652:10"/>guided by evident reaſon, cannot be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, unleſſe we will ſay, that betweene evident reaſon, and manifeſt foppery, there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: for, what greater foppery, then to thinke, that cleare and evident reaſon ſhould put us upon the wiſh, and deſires, and conſequently upon the hopes, and endeavours towards the obtaining of an impoſſibility? The diſtinction betweene evident, and obſcure, or probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is, that evident reaſon cannot confound truth with falſhood, poſſibility with impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but obſcure, or probable reaſon, may judge probable what is impoſſible. So that if evident reaſon doth ſolicite, and incline us to wiſh, and deſire that there were a God, Providence, and another life, they muſt be reall objects, and not fond impoſſibilities.</p>
               <p n="5">5 There is no wiſh, or deſire more naturall to man, nor more evidently reaſonable in it ſelf, then an abſolute inclination to juſt ſatisfaction for injuries received. The more rationall men are, the more troubled they are at tyranny, and injuſtice; the deſire of ſatisfaction in them, is greater then in any others, becauſe they have greater ſtrength of reaſon; which abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to be rid of that paine it feeleth, when we ſee in others poverty oppreſſed, or innocency condemned. Every injuſtice of a Tyrant, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour, doth occaſion in us a moſt rationall deſire of ſatisfaction, not proceeding from inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or paſſion, but from an evident dictamen of reaſon, which is clearly proved, becauſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not onely our owne, but alſo the injuries
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103652:10"/>done to others of no relation to us, and wiſh they were puniſhed, and redreſſed: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is not grounded upon ſenſe, that ſeekes no more then its owne good. But if there be not a God, Providence, and another life, all theſe our rationall deſires, and good wiſhes, are but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fooliſh inſinuations to impoſſibilities; for, ſad experience doth demonſtrate, that they who commit the greateſt tyrannies, and injuſtices, are often moſt powerfull, not ſubject to any Law, but to their owne will, and pleaſure; they are out of the reach of juſtice in this world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be another, where thoſe that ſuffer wrong, may be ſatisfied, and thoſe that doe it, puniſhed by a ſupreme Deity of infinite power, and wiſdome, whom no force can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, no policy deceive. If not, evident reaſon is a meere foppery, becauſe it ſets us upon abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute deſires of impoſſibilities, and gives us a vaine aſſurance of that we are not ſure to obtaine.</p>
               <p n="6">6 I doe not ſee how Atheiſts can diſprove this argument, without condemning themſelves, and all mankinde, for following the dictamen of reaſon in any buſineſſe. If evident reaſon may leade men to impoſſibilities, when they thinke of God, and the next life, what evidence, or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can they have in this world of not being fooled in the moſt rationall deſignes? Perhaps ſome man in his dreames may pleaſe himſelfe in this fooliſh fancy, that <hi>reaſon</hi> by the miſchiefe of wicked men is fallen into ſo great a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as to fall upon deſires of what is impoſſible to attaine. A ſad misfortune indeed, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103652:11"/>reaſon not onely miſerable, but unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which in effect is, not to be reaſon. A change greater then God himſelfe, in the opinion of any, can make, who cannot alter <hi>eſſences,</hi> to make a thing be, and not be what it is in his proper being. For, if reaſon, being reaſon, ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely incline us to gape, and graſp at impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Chimaeras,</hi> it would be ſo farre from being reaſon, that no greater foolery can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Yet peradventure waking out of his dream, he may frame us yet another wiſer objection, ſaying, that our misfortune is onely in this, not that reaſon becomes no reaſon by being turned into nonſenſe, but that we miſtake that for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is no reaſon, thinking that which ſeemes evident to us, to be the <hi>dictamen</hi> of true reaſon, whereas it may be, that our cleareſt thoughts are but ſpecious, and plauſible errours. But if this be ſo, I muſt make bould to demand of my witty adverſary, whether he doth not want both wit, and judgement? when upon the dictamens of his ſeeming reaſon, he buſies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe about the compaſſing thoſe deſignes which his ſaid ſeeming reaſon inclines him unto. And further preſſe him, whethet he ſuſpects any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in theſe following <hi>Tenets,</hi> which all may thinke they have reaſon to hold? for example, That we ought to be gratefull to our friends, dutifull to our parents, Ioyall to our Soveraignes: That we ought in generall to fly evill, ſeeke good, to enjoy what happineſſe we can with reaſon hope to obtaine. For, if reaſon be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103652:11"/>of errour, there is no reaſon to rely upon it with aſſurance in theſe moſt commonly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as rationall <hi>Tenets.</hi> Wherefore if reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining us to the deſire of a God, and another life, may be ſuſpected of errour, as deluding us with a vaine hope of what is impoſſible, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt will be obliged, to his ſhame, to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the aforeſaid principles, which no man not wholy devoyd of all ſhame, honour, and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, dare either in the preſence of others, or in his owne conſcience offer to bring into diſputation, or doubt. Now it followeth in order that we further inquire.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>VVhether it be a manifeſt foppery, not to believe that there is a God, though his exiſtence were not demonſtrated? and whether Atheiſme alone, without any other ſinne, be a reaſonable and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of damnation?</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 THe foppery of an ignorant and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſon, doth not conſiſt ſo much in his ignorance, as in his preſumption. Wiſe men may be ignorant of many things; but none can be wiſe, who preſumes to knowe what he never could learne, or is above his capacity. I doe not call Atheiſts fooles, becauſe they doe not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103652:12"/>the being of a God; but ſeeing they can have no reaſon to thinke the contrary, and that wiſer men then they, doe confidently affirme, that God is demonſtrated, its want of judgement not to believe what they doe not, or will not comprehend, eſpecially when they runne the greateſt of all hazards by not believing. He that is reſolved not to take any knowledge by truſt, or tradition, is rather a beaſt, then a rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is not fit for humane ſociety, neither can he pretend any kindred, or inheritance, there being no proofe for either, if we reject the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of lawfull witneſſes. There is not a more univerſall, or conſtant tradition, or teſtimony of lawfull witneſſes for any thing, then for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, Providence, and another life; though it were never demonſtrated, it ought to be credited, eſpecially by Atheiſts, who are as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as preſumptuous of knowledge. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read that any of the ancient Philoſophers, or great wits of the world, contradicted the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods being: two, or three of the loweſt banke, rather <hi>Philologers,</hi> then <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> as <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Lucian,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> looked that way, becauſe they declined from vertue, and never inclined their minds to ſolid learning, and would faine have rid themſelves of the remorſe of conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, the ſoure ſauce wherewith ſenſuall delights are ſeaſoned.</p>
               <p n="2">2 One of the greateſt fooleries a man can commit, is, to caſt himſelfe into a manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without cauſe; for, danger is not onely the forerunner of evill, but is an evill it ſelfe. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103652:12"/>a man to the hazard of looſing his life, is an evill done him, though by good fortune he ſhould eſcape. And albeit Atheiſts fancy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that God is but a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and the next world, <hi>Vtopia,</hi> they cannot deny, that this fancy expoſeth them to a manifeſt danger of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe if the contrary prove true, as it may for all they knowe, the evidence of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will fooles undeceive them, and drive them out of their fooles paradiſe, when repentance will be too late. The greater appearance there is of any evill, the greater is the danger; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a God (though not the reality) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evident to Atheiſts, in the fabrike and order of the <hi>Vniverſe,</hi> as alſo in many ſupernaturall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and prodigies: by denying him, they muſt of neceſſity incurre the danger of his indignation, in caſe he doth exiſt; from which they cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally expect to be freed, by the pretended pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of their erroneous opinion; becauſe though it ſhould be as probable as they imagine, that there is not a God, yet the choice of an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion more dangerous in practiſe, then probable in ſpeculation, as theirs is, is ſo great a foppery, that onely mad men can ground upon it their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and thinke it a ſufficient ſatisfaction for divine Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And though we ſhould grant to Atheiſts, that its poſſible we may be miſtaken in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and hopes of God, and another life; yet we ſuffer no great prejudice by the miſtake: to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from baſe and tranſitory pleaſures, cannot be any great loſſe. But if they will conſider the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103652:13"/>much we have reaſon to hope for, and the little advantage they have of vertuous men, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vice; and will alſo reflect upon the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they runne by denying and offending God: they muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that though our hopes ſhould come to nothing, we cannot be deprived of this ſatisfaction, and praiſe, that we did in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and actions, what rationall men ought to have done, all circumstances conſidered; whereas they, in this world, muſt be eſteemed no better then fooles, for running ſo manifeſt a hazard of damnation: and if there be no other life, we are no worſe then they, becauſe they cannot brag of their choice made in this world, nor receive in the other any congratulations of friends, for the good fortune they had, in preferring here vice before vertue, and Atheiſme before Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But now let us prove, that though Atheiſts had no other ſinne but Atheiſme, they can have no excuſe to alledge, for not believing and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God; but rather that they doe him a poſitive injury, and therefore are juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Men may have evidence of their owne obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to believe a truth that is not evident.The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is not any principle more evident then that which commands us, <hi>to deale with others as our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves would be dealt withall:</hi> what Atheiſt is there, that would not take it for an injury, to be treated like a clowne, and a knave, if he hath the garbe, habit, and attendance of a Prince, and all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes of morall honeſty? If there be an evident obligation not to injure others, and it be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103652:13"/>an injury not to treate perſons according to their appearance, its manifeſt that all men are obliged to believe, that there is a God, who ought to be honoured and adored, becauſe there is greater appearance of his infinite power and wiſdome in what is viſible to our eyes, then any Atheiſt, or other man can ſhew for his owne nobility, or morality. If every perſon may challenge a right to be treated according to his exteriour appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, though his quality be not evident, its an injury to God, and a damnable ſinne, to except his Divine Majeſty from ſo generall a rule. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce it doth follow, that though men had no other ſinne to anſwer for, but Atheiſme, that alone is a ſufficient and juſt cauſe of their damnation.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The bare poſſibility of being miſtaken in a mans quality, or dignity, is no ſufficient warrant to deny him that honour and reſpect, which is due to others of his ranke, and doth ſufficiently appeare in himſelfe by evident ſignes, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentike teſtimonies. Its very certaine that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtours have counterfeited, and abuſed not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly titles of Nobility, but alſo the dignity of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. But the fault of few ought not to prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the right of many, and its better to runne the hazard of being miſtaken, then to abuſe others. If the obligation of paying the tribute of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and reſpect, where it ſeemeth to be due, be ſo preciſe, that it muſt not be denyed to any who may claime it, notwithstanding the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of impoſtures, and miſtakes; how much more preciſe is our obligation not to deny re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and honour to an appearance that cannot
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103652:14"/>be counterfeited? The fabrike, order, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Vniverſe,</hi> together with the miracles, and ſupernaturall prodigies, that are viſible to ſuch, and ſo many, as make them credible to all, are things we may admire, but not imitate. No Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtour will venter to counterfeit ſo rare a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, as the great machine of this world.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Seeing therefore that ſomething there is, which ſeemes by theſe effects to be moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, moſt wiſe, and moſt perfect, we ought ſo to judge, and believe, and give it due honour, and reſpect. The right to ſuch duties, acquired by outward appearance, and ſignes, doth extend it ſelfe even to our inward and moſt ſecret thoughts, which is the onely reaſon why a raſh judgement is a ſinne, and why men may be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious in thinking ill of others, as in backbiting. If we muſt not judge otherwiſe of men, then they ſeeme to be, much leſſe of God. We muſt not be Chriſtians in our words, and Atheiſts in our thoughts. Therefore the obligation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, honouring, and loving God, is evident, though the Deity it ſelfe were not as evident as it is, even to the moſt vulgar underſtandings, that are not ſtupified by vice, and beſotted with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall pleaſures. Now, ſuppoſing its demonſtrated that there is a God, or at leaſt that we are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of our obligation to believe there is one, we may proceed to inquire,</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether God ought to be ſerved his owne way, and in what manner?</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 THere is not an abſolute Prince, that doth not pretend as his birthright, or preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>to be ſerved his owe way,</hi> that is, as himſelfe thinks fit, and not according to his Subjects diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. If this be granted to Princes, our fellow Creatures, how can it be denyed to the Creator? Princes may erre in the conduct of affaires, God is infallible. Princes may employ unfit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, men not valued, or hated by their people: God by employing men, doth enable them, and ſupply their defects. Princes may looke more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne intereſt, then upon the common good, in their projects, and deſignes: God can have no deſigne upon his Creatures, but their owne good; his intereſt is their happineſſe. To be briefe, Princes are men, and though no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet ſubject to all humane frailties; but God is as free from any frailty, as from ſubjection. Therefore if according the maxime of Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Princes muſt be ſerved their owne way, God muſt not be deprived of the like preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Whether Princes ought to be ſerved their owne Way, is not for my preſent purpoſe to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; yet I muſt preſume to tell them, that its no part of their prerogative, to define, or declare,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103652:15"/>what way God hath appointed for his owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: the politick ends are not alwayes agreable, or compatible with Gods ordinations, and in ſuch caſe we muſt ſerve Princes in Gods way, not in their owne: no humane Lawes, or Kings pleaſure ought to be preferred before Gods commandments. Its as evident that God may chooſe his owne way of being worſhipped, as it is manifeſt that worſhip is due to ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. Some Rites and ceremonies of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may be left to mens choice, and diſcretion; but before they undertake it, they muſt ſhew their commiſſion for ſo great a power, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a charge. Every one muſt not preſume to be Maſter of ceremonies in Gods Church, and Court. If there were not a way ſetled for the worſhip of God before we came into the world, perhaps every man might chooſe his owne; but to intrude new Rites, and Lawes into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, contrary to the government long eſtabliſhed, hath beene alwayes judged in the State, dangerous, and in the Church, damnable. Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> in his bookes of <hi>Eccleſiasticall Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> is much admired, and cryed up by ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, becauſe he proves, by Catholick argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Church of God may command the practiſe of Rites, and ceremonies: but he is farre from proving, that the new fangled Engliſh Proteſtant Church is the Church of God, and therefore could never conclude, that Puritans, or any others, ought to ſute themſelves in the new faſhion of the Church of Englands formalities, becauſe they muſt ſhew their authority, before
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103652:15"/>they intrude their formalities, and take away realities.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Its as unwarrantable to reject ancient Rites, and ceremonies, as to impoſe new ones, without authentike teſtimonies, and ſignes of divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. If the Church that went before us, and upon whoſe relation we muſt depend for the knowledge of times paſt, doth teſtify, that ſuch ceremonies as ſeeme now to fooles, ridiculous, and to the ignorant, ſuperfluous, were invented by God, or by men, to whom he committed the care of our inſtruction; we muſt practiſe them, &amp; perſuade our ſelves, that it is not in the power of any <hi>Nags-head</hi> Convocation,<note place="margin">The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends from a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated at the <hi>Nags-head</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> invalidly for many reaſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in a late Booke of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, and Hereſy.</note> to frame a new Religion or 39.

Puritans proceed more conſequently, they retaine no Popiſh dregs, nor rags of Rome, (as they call them) and firmely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God cannot be ſerved in ſpirit, if the Miniſter of his Word appeareth not before him in <hi>cuerpo,</hi> rid of all Aaronicall ornaments. But with their good leave, to ſerve and worſhip God in ſpirit, is not to reject or reforme ancient Rites and ceremonies, but rather by performing them, the ſpirit is raiſed to God with reflexion upon the myſteries in them contained.

There is not one ceremony practiſed in the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, which deriveth not its beginning from God, or by his authority from primitive times; all relate to divine Myſteries, as you may read in <hi>Durantius De ritibus Eccleſiae Catholicae,</hi> and in that excellent Booke, <hi>The Protestants Apology for the Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Whereas ceremonies be the object of phantaſy, and ours are ſo decent, that no phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy can except more againſt them, then againſt thoſe of the Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> inſtituted by God himſelfe, and approved by Proteſtants, the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they manifeſt againſt our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, cannot proceed ſo much from their fancy, as from their underſtanding, diſſenting from that Doctrine to which the Ceremonies relate. To <hi>kneele,</hi> is not an object ridiculous, or offenſive to the fancy: the moſt preciſe practiſe it out of Churches, and at Court; and yet all Proteſtants cry <hi>abomination</hi> againſt kneeling to our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:103652:16"/>Chriſt in the Sacrament, or worſhiping himſelfe, or his Saints in Images; theſe ceremonies agree well enough with their fancy, but their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot brooke them. A weake under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may occaſion as great errours, as a ſtrong fancy.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Some fantaſticall and fanaticall fellowes, call the Roman Catholick Religion, an <hi>Apith</hi> Keli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becauſe forſooth, it hath ſo many odde ceremonies. But the fault is not in the Roman Religion, or ceremonies, they have Apiſh under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, they looke as Apes upon our ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, without conſidering the myſteries. All the ceremonies of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> relate to Chriſts Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, others to the myſteries of the Trinity and Incarnation. If it was lawful and laudable in the old Law, to practiſe ceremonies repreſenting things that were to come, why ſhould we Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks be cenſured for ceremonies that put us in minde of paſt myſteries, and mercies? We ought not to be unmindfull, or ungratefull, and there is not a more efficacious way to preſerve a gratefull memory of paſt benefits, then by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them in ceremonies to the light.</p>
               <p n="6">6 I muſt confeſſe that all Sectaries have as great cauſe to cry downe ceremonies, as we Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks have to uphold them. Becauſe the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt pillar of the true Church, is a continuall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Catholick Doctrine from the primitive times to this preſent, and this pillar of <hi>Tradition</hi> is much ſtrengthened by the practiſe of ceremonies relating to that Doctrine delivered from hand to hand, which we now maintaine as Catholick,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103652:17"/>againſt Hereſy, or pretended Reformation. To adore the bleſſed Sacrament both in Church, and Proceſſions, is a ſtrong argument of Chriſts reall preſence, not onely in the act or uſe of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but alſo before, and after. What mervaile therefore, that they who deny Chriſts reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or grant it onely in the actuall uſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſhould oppoſe the adoration, whereby their falſe Doctrine is ſo clearly condemned by the practiſe of the faith full; theſe, and other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ceremonies, are not odious to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants becauſe they are ceremonies, but becauſe they put them in minde of the ancient Faith and Doctrine of Chriſts Church. To reject ſome of the ancient ceremonies, and retaine others (as the <hi>Nags-head</hi> Congregation doth) is to furniſh their adverſaries (Catholicks and Puritans) with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable arguments; their choice of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies doth prove their choice of Doctrine, and their choice of Doctrine demonſtrates them He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; an Heretick being he, who chooſeth out of the Doctrine delivered by the Church what he fancies, rejecting what he thinkes not fit for his purpoſe. Our Prelaticall Proteſtants muſt, with the reſt, caſt away their Biſhops bonnet, lawne ſleeves, he white ſurpliſe, and black ſcarfe; if not, they may caſt their cap, and deſpaire of anſwering to Catholick or Puritan objections: they muſt keepe all, or nothing, unleſſe they can produce better evidence for their pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, then the fancy of 7. or 12. men in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth his time, confirmed by the authority of a yong head of the Church, and a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103652:17"/>Parliament called by the Protector <hi>Seamour,</hi> to eſtabliſh in England <hi>Zwinglian</hi> fopperies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Chriſtian Doctrine, and diſcipline of our Catholick Anceſtors; they muſt not rely upon Queen <hi>Elizabeths ſhe ſupremacy,</hi> or their <hi>Nags-head</hi> Ordination, and Synod, with their <hi>London</hi> Aſſemblies, and <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> Conferences of lay Miniſters. God muſt be ſerved his owne way, and not by framing Religions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>That to believe God, and conſequently to ſerve him his owne way, its neceſſary to repaire to an infallible Guide, which is no other but the Roman Catholick Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 THe firſt ſtep in the way of Gods ſervice, is, <hi>to believe God;</hi> a ſtep of no leſſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then neceſſity. Suppoſe there were a man dropt downe from the heavens, graced with this ſingular privilege, that the ſound of his words could no ſooner be at our eares, then the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of their truth before our eyes; whatſoever he ſaid, in the ſame inſtant we did ſee confirmed by the reall appearance of the objects, and our own
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103652:18"/>experience. This ſingular privilege would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of another, common to all men of worth and integrity; it would make him unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable or being believed; all who heare him, would aſſent to what he ſaid, but for their owne evidence, not for his veracity. When any thing is evident to our underſtanding, or to our eyes, we believe our ſelves, and not others, though they ſhould tell us the ſame we doe experience. If God were pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf to men in ſuch a manner, that they had evidence it is he who ſpeaketh to them, he had deprived us of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith, and himſelfe of that duty which we are obliged to give every honeſt man: for, though Divine Faith doth exclude all doubts and feares of falſhood, yet it ſuppoſeth in the ſubject a poſſibility of doubting, if men will be obſtinate and imprudent; but there is none ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and imprudent, that can doubt of the truth of Gods words, if it be evident to him that God ſpoke them. Though we heare men ſpeak, we doe them a courteſie in believing them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are fallible, and we doe not read the truth in their words, though we believe them; but if we had evidence that God uttered any words, the truth of them muſt be as cleare, as it is, that he can neither lye, nor be miſtaken: and if the truth be cleare, and evident to our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, we believe our ſelves, and not God, though he ſhould ſpeake it. To <hi>believe,</hi> is to truſt, and he that hath evidence of any truth, doth as little truſt the ſpeaker, as we rely upon anothers credit for the money we have in our own coffers.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:103652:18"/>
               <p n="2">2 Seeing therefore that either God muſt not be believed by men, or that he muſt diſguiſe himſelfe, and ſpeake to them by others, who can be ſo impudent as to deny, that we deſerve dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we doe not believe and obey God in that Church, which he hath beene pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute as his owne Interpreter,<note place="margin">Quod au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem rogant unde perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debimur, à Deo fluxiſſe Scripturam, niſi ad Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleiſae decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giamus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde eſt, ac ſi quu roget unde diſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus lucem diſcernere à tenebris, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum &amp; ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro &amp;c. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Inſt.

                  </note> for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? I cannot deny, there is great difficulty in believing, that every thing which the Church propoſeth as revealed, is Gods revelation; yet this pill muſt be ſwallowed, if we reſolve to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve God, who cannot be believed if he ſpeakes in his owne voice, and tone; becauſe it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently inſeparable from truth; and we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what by force of cleare evidence we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny. Hence (by the way) it followeth, that no Proteſtant, or Puritan, doth believe God, if they ground their faith upon the evidence they pretend to have of Scriptures being Gods Word or upon that of their private ſpirit; both which (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) are diſcerned as clearly by himſelfe, and his brethren, to be Divine evidences, and not Diabolicall, as <hi>white</hi> is diſcerned from <hi>black, ſweete</hi> from <hi>ſoure,</hi> and <hi>light</hi> from <hi>darkneſſe.</hi> Its very improbable that God deprived himſelfe of his right, and was contented not to be believed, that <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his Proteſtant crue, might be eaſed of a duty, which they exact and receive from every perſon that hath a good opinion of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Suppoſing it is as evident that there is a Church of God upon earth, as it is reaſonable he ought to be believed by men, we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103652:19"/>to finde it our. The Church is an infallible Guide to lead us to God: but who is the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Guide to had us to the Church? Reaſon. But reaſon in obſcurity may be miſtaken; and what is more obſcure, then the way to the true Church environed with ſo many falſe Sects? If our bel efe were limited to naturall verities, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might make ſome ſhift, every man might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that his owne wit would be a ſufficient guide for himſelfe: but ſeeing Chriſtian Faith muſt ſtretch further then humane capacity, there muſt be ſome ſupernaturall helpe. In obſcure matters, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> (with all wiſe men) reaſon muſt be contented with cleare ſignes, and not expect evidence of the truth And becauſe the Church or God doth propoſe ſupernaturall truths, the ſignes muſt be alſo ſupernaturall. And becauſe there is ſo great difference betweene hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtandings God hath beene pleaſed to make his Church diſcernable by ſenſible and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupernaturall ſignes, that they who have leaſt underſtanding, may not have leſſe faith then the moſt witty and learned, if they will but open their eyes, and reflect upon what they ſee. This is the reaſon why ſo few can pretend ignorance of the true Church if they have any ſenſe in them, they may eaſily diſtinguiſh it from all hereticall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. The evident ſignes therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the true and Catholick Church is knowne, conſiſteth not in exteriour formalities, that may take their beginning from humane policy, or from a naturall inclination to decency, and good order. The Proteſtant Church of England had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103652:19"/>as few ſignes of ſupernaturall grace, as any other pretending Reformation, yet in the eyes of ſome it lookt pretily, and was more decent in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, then other Northerne Churches of Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans; and ſome of their <hi>Nags-bead</hi> Miniſters affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a certaine Eccleſiaſticall gravity in their garb and habit; notwithſtanding in my opinion a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dreſſe would better become their meere ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and want of ordination. The Miniſters in <hi>Germany</hi> looke more <hi>Proteſtantlike</hi> in their ſhort cloakes, ſpade beards, and blew ſtarcht ruffs, then our Engliſh Common-prayer Miniſters doe in their long cloakes, and ſurpliſes, which they weare more for policy, then Religion</p>
               <p n="4">4 Seeing Reaſon muſt be contented with cleare ſignes, when the truth is not evident, and that no evident or cleare ſupernaturall ſignes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in any Congregation of men, but in the Roman Catholick; it muſt be concluded, that the true Church is that onely Congregation of men, which profeſſe the Roman Catholick Faith. That no ſignes of grace doe appeare in any Church pretending Reformation, is as cleare, as it is, that all the world is not blind; for, as yet neither themſelves, nor any other, could ſee in any of their Sects, one miracle, or any other thing that lookt like ſupernaturall; though they tell us of ſome Divine motions, and impulſes of the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſpirit, they are as incredible, as it is impoſſible that God ſhould oblige any man to take a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants bare word, againſt the tradition and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Chriſtian world informer ages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with undeniable miracles, and ſanctity of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103652:20"/>life. But ſome ſeeing the private ſpirit is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, would faine perſwade us, that we may read their Reformation in Scripture ſo evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they wonder how we can have the leaſt doubt againſt it.

               <p n="5">5 I will not make a long Litanies of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and viſible ſignes which app are in the Roman Catholick Church. Miracles have beene in all ages, and are now ſo frequent amongſt us,

Not to ſpeake of <hi>Antomes, Hilarions,</hi> or <hi>Stilluas</hi> lets drawe nearer our times, and conſider the lives of Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi> Saint <hi>Dominike,</hi> Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> Saint <hi>Vincent Ferrer,</hi> Saint <hi>Francis of Paula,</hi> Saint <hi>Charles Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus,</hi> Saint <hi>Tereſa,</hi> Saint <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> and many more, who were knowne Roman Catholicks, profeſſing the ſame Tenets, and obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which we now maintaine againſt pretended Reformation. And not to ſpeake onely of the dead, let any indifferent perſon conſider, how in all vocations of both Clergy and Layty, we have many perſons eminent in vertue, farre above that degree of morality, to which ſome Proteſtants may attaine, as well as ſome Pagans and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who were farre from Chriſtian perfection, called <hi>ſanctity</hi> of life. Let our Engliſh Proteſtant be pleaſed to weigh with himſelfe, whether yong Ladies of as great quality, fortunes, and gifts of nature as <hi>England</hi> doth afford, could forſake their native Countrey kindred, and friends, contemne all pleaſures of the world and themſelves, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing a religious, poore, and penitent life in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall end ſure, ſubmitting their wills to the obedience and humour of a woman: could this, I ſay, be performed by ſo many, ſo continually, and with ſo great alacrity and content of minde, without a miraculous and ſupernaturall grace of the Almighty? In my judgement its a greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, that ſuch perſons ſhould reſolve by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary baniſhiment to dye to their Countrey, and friends, and to the whole world by a religious profeſſion, and to bury themſelves alive in a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103652:21"/>Cloyſter; then if they had reſtored life to others, and baniſht death from graves and monuments.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Now after that our Proteſtant Gentleman hath conſidered our Catholick Monaſteries, let him examine, whether in his owne Church there hath beene, or now is, any thing reſembling ſo much Religion, and ſupernaturall vertue, as that which amongſt us is not admired (though admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) becauſe ſo ordinary. This kinde of life is as farre from Proteſtants practiſe and Doctrine, as it is from naturall inclination. Yet I have heard, that Maſter <hi>Laud</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was once incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to erect ſome Proteſtant Nunneries in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I believe it would occaſion as great ſtirres as his Reformation did in <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe no thing is more oppoſite to the Tenets of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Ghoſpel, and firſt Reformers, then to make vowes of poverty, chaſtity, and obedience, Proteſtancy begunne, and is founded upon the diſſolving of Monaſteries and religions vowes, and is not compatible with their obſervance, if things muſt be carried on by the ſame meanes that acquired them a being. Its very true that <hi>Cranmer</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the firſt Patriarch of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy in England, cauſed an encloſure of wood to be made, I meane a <hi>Chest,</hi> wherein he ſhut up his woman, and carryed her along with himſelfe whereſoever he travailed; whereof enſued an odde accident at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> where the <hi>Cheſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much rccomended to thoſe that carryed it to the Inne, as containing pretious ſtuffe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Lords grace, they ſevered it from the reſt, and put it up end-long againſt the wall in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103652:22"/>my Lords chamber, with the womans head downward, which putting her in jeopardy to breake her necke, ſhe was forced at length to cry out, and ſo the Chamberlins helpt her out of her encloſure. This is amoſt certaine ſtory (ſaith my Author in his Examen of <hi>Fox</hi> his Calendar <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 27.) and teſtified at this day by <hi>Cranmers</hi> ſons widdowe yet living The Prelates of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church carry portable Altars: but the firſt Proteſtant Prelate, and reformed Apoſtle of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, could not travaile without his portable Monaſtery, farre more agreable to the Religion he planted, then Matter <hi>Lauds</hi> intended plantation of religious and chaſt Nunneries.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The converſion of Nations to Chriſtianity, is not onely a ſigne of the true Church, but alſo the end of its inſtitution. This is ſo proper to the Roman Catholick, even at this preſent, that none who heard the names of <hi>America, Angola, China, Monomotappa, India,</hi> or <hi>Iaponia,</hi> can be ignorant of our pious endeavours, and miraculous ſucceſſe, in preaching the Ghoſpel to ſo remote Nations, where nothing that is coveted in this world, could be aymed at, or expected by our Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Preachers. I will not ſay any more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſignes of the true Church, theſe being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convince any perſon that deſires to be ſaved, that out or the Roman Church there is no ſalvation, ſeeing it alone hath ſupernaturall and viſible ſignes, whereby God doth declare ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently that it is an infallible guide, to informe men of his myſteries, and direct them in the way he hath preſcribed for his Divine ſervice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103652:22"/>all mortalls to heare and obey it, as they would heare and obey himſelfe. Whoſoever doth the contrary, injures God, and calleth his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne veracity in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="9">9 God is as much injured by Proteſtants, and all others who deny, or doubt of what the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church propoſeth in his name, as any man can be injured, by not being believed when he ſpeakes. The injury done to men when they are not believed, conſiſts in not truſting them, or in not taking their word for the truth, though the truth doth not appeare. If we doe not truſt God, and take his Word, as it is uttered by the Roman Catholick Church, for truth, we are reſolved not to truſt him at all, becauſe when any truth is evident to us, we cannot receive it by truſt from another; and if God ſhould ſpeake im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to us, and declare that himſelfe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the truth of his words is as evident to us, as it is that he cannot lye; and by conſequence there is no roome left for truſt. Therefore either we muſt truſt him, and take his Word for truth, when he ſpeakes by that Church which hath ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural ſignes, or not at all; and that Church is onely the Roman Catholick. That God doth not ſpeake to us immediatly by himſelfe, as men doe, but by the Church, doth not diminiſh the injury, but makes it poſſible. It doth not diminiſh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury clone to God, becauſe it doth appeare as clearly and ſuffiently, by the teſtimony and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall ſignes of the Roman Catholick Church, that what is by it propoſed, is Gods Word, as it doth appeare by any mans owne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103652:23"/>and ſignes of integrity and ſincerity, that he ſpeaketh truth. To be ſolicitous to knowe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently who is the Author of any words, when he diſguiſeth himſelfe, and deſires to be <hi>incognito,</hi> is too much curioſity, and ill manners. But a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to believe any words propoſed as Divine revelation by the Church, becauſe it is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that God is the Author of them, is hereticall obſtinacy. For, its unreaſonable to exact a clearer knowledge of the Author, then of the truth of the words: if we are bound to believe the truth, though it be not evident, we can have no reaſon to exact evidence of the Author, eſpecially when the truth of his words muſt be evident, if he be knowne, and conſequently our reſolution doth extend it ſelfe to this, that we will not believe, untill the truth be evident, which is not onely obſtinacy, but manifeſt foppery, becauſe it is as much as to ſay, We will believe nothing at all. Its therefore as evident an injury to God to deny the Doctrine of the Roman Catholick Church, though it be not evident that God is the Author thereof, as it is, to deny the truth of any mens words when they ſpeake themſelves, though the truth be not evident; unleſſe perhaps we thinke it reaſonable to exact of God what we cannot of men, to wit, whenſoever he ſpeakes, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his words unleſſe we have evidence of their truth: for, if God be truth, and we are reſolved not to believe his words unleſſe he manifeſts himſelfe, we are reſolved not to believe them, untill their truth be manifeſt, ſeeing God is the truth of his owne words, becauſe he is truth by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103652:23"/>
                  <hi>eſſence.</hi> Of men we exact not ſo much, we believe their words, though the truth be obſcure.</p>
               <p n="10">10 This injury which is done to God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in calling in queſtion his <hi>veracity,</hi> which is an inclination to ſpeake truth. Gods veracity is called in queſtion whenſoever any thing is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed as his Word, and yet it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it is his Word, or revelation. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the matter ſufficiently propoſed by the Church as Gods Word, and conſequently as truth, be great or ſmall, abſolutely neceſſary or not, it matters not, as to the deniall or doubt of Gods veracity; becauſe he is as neceſſarily incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpeake truth in a matter of little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in the greateſt. Seeing therefore that the deniall or doubt of mens veracity, conſiſts in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning what is ſufficiently propoſed as their ſenſe and meaning; and that the Doctrine and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Scripture, embraced by the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, is ſufficiently propoſed by its teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and evident ſupernaturall ſignes, to be the ſenſe, revelation, and meaning of God; his vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city muſt be as much queſtioned by calling in queſtion the leaſt Doctrine of the Roman Church, as the veracity of men is called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, by doubting of their words, whereby their thoughts and meaning are ſufficiently propoſed.</p>
               <p n="11">11 From what hitherto hath beene ſaid, its as evidently concluded, that the Roman Catholick Church is infallible in all matters, great and ſmall, propoſed by it as Divine revelation, as it is cleare, that God would have men believe him, or that he hath a regard to his owne honour and veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103652:24"/>he is not concerned in either, if he permits any one falihood in the leaſt matter, neceſſary for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or not neceſſary, to be ſufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Church, as his Word, or ſenſe; ſeeing he may ſo eaſily prevent it, and not permit the Roman Catholick Church to erre in any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. How can God exact, or expect from us an undoubted or infallible beliefe, when he ſpeaketh and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>clareth his minde by men, if thoſe very men be not infallible in declaring his minde? What injury can it be to God, that we doubt of his veracity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if in his owne hearing and preſence, his owne Interpreter, the Church, is by himſelfe permitted to erre, and abuſe his name and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? We may lawfully ſuſpect his ſincerity in greater matters, ſeeing the leaſt blemiſh is as much as the greateſt inconſiſtent with the infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature. Therefore either God is contented not to be believed, and to forfeit his honour and the eſteeme of his veracity, or that Church which hath evident and ſupernaturall ſignes of being his Interpreter, (which is the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick alone) is infallible in all matters, great and ſmall, propoſed as Divine revelation.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Hence you may gather to what great fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries hereticall obſtinacy doth lead ſome of the moſt learned Miniſters of the Engliſh Church, when they print, that God is ſatisfied with an exteriour acquieſcence to the definitions of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, and of that Church which alone hath the ſignes and markes of being the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, though there remaineth an inward doubt of the controverſy defined. This is as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103652:24"/>much as to ſay, that God is content you give him the lye, or afront him in private, ſo you be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſay nothing of it in publick. God is as much injured by thoughts, as by words, and an exteriour acquieſcence is no ſatisfaction to him, without interiour ſubmiſſion of judgement. Its true, ſome of theſe Hereticks grant, that when all the Patriarchs, and Chriſtian Churches of the world conferre notes, and are aſſembled together in a Councell, (which is not likely to be as farre as the preſent ſtate of the world doth promiſe, untill we all meete in the Valley of <hi>Ioſaphat</hi>) then is the time to ſubmit our judgements, which in plaine termes, is to put of all Chriſtian beliefe, and obedience to God in his Church, and remaine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in hereſie, untill the day of judgement. But of this more when we ſpeake in particular of the Engliſh Church in King <hi>Iames</hi> and his ſonnes reigne.

Some write as a great miracle, that his heart reſiſted the flames; it may paſſe for a <hi>Proteſtant miracle,</hi> that the moſt hard, and maſſy part of mans fleſh, ſhould not be as ſoone conſumed as the reſt. Such a miracle, to my knowledge, happened of late to the heart of an infamous malefactor burnt at <hi>Gant;</hi> and ſuch

                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Carolſtadius</hi> was Archdeacon of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> and had the honour to conferre the degree of <hi>Doctor</hi> upon <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> to whom he adhered in the beginning of his Reformation; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards denying the reall preſence, he was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by <hi>Luther,</hi> that he was forced to retire to a village, and gaine his living by cutting wood, and ſelling fagots, a dangerous occupation for an Hererick, if it were in <hi>Spaine,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> where his fuel would be applied to his owne uſe. At length being weary of that life, he caſt himſelfe into <hi>Zwinglius</hi> his hands, and opinions. He is ſaid to be the firſt Prieſt that married; to celebrate his Nuptials with greater ſolemnity, he writ to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman his neighbour, deſiring him to ſend him ſome <hi>veniſon,</hi> and the Nobleman, very diſcreetly, ſent him the head of an aſſe well dreſſed, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, for a buck: the miſtake was not perceived, untill the yong couple had eaten ſo much of the ſuppoſed veniſon, that they fell to pick crummes,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103652:32"/>and at length to picke the aſſes eares, to their great confuſion, laughter of the company, and extraordinary contentment of him that ſent the preſent, good enough for ſo ſacrilegious a feaſt and ſolemnity. The Lutheran writers ſay, that <hi>Carolſtadius</hi> in his laſt Sermon did ſee the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, who came to applaude his Doctrine; and three dayes after being ſick, he came to fetch his perſon: the Sacramentarians deny this ſtory; but Catholicks believe that he is gone to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, though they will not diſpute whether the Devill came to ſee him in his laſt Sermon or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> was a Prieſt, and a Monke of Saint <hi>Brigits</hi> order, infamous for being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of ſo notorious lyes in his writings.

They were ſo vaine and ambitious of being eſteemed Authors of new Religions, that though all three agreed in the ſubſtance of their errour, yet every one would needs maintaine it upon a different word and ground, from the reſt, <hi>Carolſtadius</hi> denyed the reall preſence, becauſe he ſaid, that the word, <hi>Hoc, This,</hi> was not referred by <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Saviour to what he had in his hands, but onely to himſelfe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103652:33"/>as ſitting at the table. <hi>Zwinglius</hi> laid hold of the word <hi>Est, is,</hi> and interpreted it, <hi>ſignificat, ſignifieth</hi> my body, thruſting into the very text <hi>ſignifieth,</hi> and taking out <hi>is. Oecolampadius</hi> grounded his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall errour upon the word <hi>Corpus, Body,</hi> which he interpreted <hi>figura corporis, a figure of the body,</hi> not according to the language of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but as if the <hi>figure</hi> did exclude the <hi>reality</hi> of a body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Tertullians</hi> phraſe and doctrine, as <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> in his Comments upon him, doth plainely ſhew by many examples. Thus we ſee, how three <hi>Sycophants</hi> have rendred to their followers the words of God not onely ineſſicacious, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unſignificant; and how the moſt abſurd drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of a diſtempered braine worke upon ſimple people: and how apt Polititians are to worke their ends with thefe mad fancies, my Reader may ſee in the Protector <hi>Seamour,</hi> who brought into England this Zwinglian Religion, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, when I ſpeake of the Engliſh Church in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth his time.</p>

At <hi>Liege</hi> he was refuſed entertainment, and ſo was forced to returne into France, and live pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly at <hi>Poitiers.</hi> It happened that walking there in a garden, he fell into diſcourſe of the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions with ſome more curious, then learned: the queſtion was, whether <hi>Luther</hi> his opinion was more tolerable in matter of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103652:34"/>that of <hi>Zwinglius. Calvin</hi> laid hold of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to declare his owne, condemning both the former.

Its better take <hi>Christ</hi> at his word, then rely upon <hi>Calvins</hi> pledge. Neither himſelfe, nor any of his Diſciples could hitherto ſpeake ſenſe, when they declared their ſenſe and Doctrine in this particular: and no mervaile, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there can be no ſenſe in a meane betweene two contradictions; for, either <hi>Chriſt</hi> is realy preſent in the Sacrament, or he is not realy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; whether the reality of his preſence be after a ſpirituall, or corporall manner, is not the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; a ſpirituall preſence is as reall, as a corporall. To ſay that <hi>Chriſts</hi> body and bloud is not realy in the Sacrament by themſelves, but onely by our faith, is as much as to ſay, that they are not there, though we believe they are; which is not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and true faith, becauſe we are miſtaken. However this nonſenſe ſerved <hi>Calvins</hi> turne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a new <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and much applauded by his firſt foure Diſciples, <hi>Anthony Duguius, Philip Veronius, Albert Babinot,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Vernovius,</hi> to whom he infuſed his ſpirit, and ſent them to preach his Doctrine in divers parts of France, and diſtribute his fantaſticall communion. But when it came to his cares, that ſome who denyed the reall preſence, were cruelly tormented, and put
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103652:35"/>to death in <hi>Paris,</hi> he thought fit to retire to his old Maſter <hi>Ruſus,</hi> and partake with him of the Queene of <hi>Navars</hi> protection; reſolved not to ſuffer that Martyrdome, to which he had ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly and earneſtly exhorted others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 After ſome time he parted with <hi>Rufus,</hi> and repaired to <hi>Baſile,</hi> where he publiſhed his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in French, that at leaſt the language might incline ignorant people to believe that the worke was his owne. In the beginning of his booke he put a fiery ſword with this <hi>Motto, Non veni pacem mittere, ſed gladium; I come not with peace, but with the ſword.</hi> Never was the deſigne or effect of any booke better expreſſed; there is not a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where it was received, that felt not the ſad effects of warre, fire, and ſword, being as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with peace and obedience to the Prince, or Magiſtrate,<note place="margin">Calvin. in <hi>5.</hi> Daniel.</note> as with Catholick Religion.

The Ringleader of all this miſchiefe was one <hi>William Farellus,</hi> a Frenchman by birth, a Jew by deſcent, and an Heretick by profeſſion. The inſtrument whereby he effected this worke, was <hi>Amicus Perrinus,</hi> a man of great power in Geneva, and Captaine of the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſo bitter an enemy to Prieſts, and the Maſſe, that he commanded the Altar ſtone of the Cathedrall Church to be carried out of Towne, and laid in

But being proud, and forcing his diſcipline upon the people, both he and <hi>Farellus</hi> were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from <hi>Geneva</hi> in the yeare 1538. <hi>Calvin</hi> reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Stratzburg,</hi> where firſt he taught a Schoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and afterwards tooke upon him the care of a Church, which the Magiſtrate granted to the French Hereticks. Here he tooke to wife an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts widdowe, and though I have nothing to ſay againſt his marriage, becauſe I doe not read that ever he received holy Orders, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he had two benefices conferred upon him when he was yong; yet much is writ by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his diſhoneſt life; the Lord of <hi>Fallarie</hi> his wife was forced to goe live at <hi>Lauſanna,</hi> to be rid of <hi>Calvins</hi> importunity, and adulterous attempts: the Lady of <hi>Mong is</hi> was not ſo honeſt, ſhe left her huſband at <hi>Lauſanna,</hi> and lived incontinently with <hi>Calvin</hi> at <hi>Geneva.</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103652:36"/>earneſt with the Magiſtrate for his returne, which was not onely permitted, but decreed, and he invited ſolemnly by the Senate, not doubting by his meanes and credit amongſt new Sectaries, to ſtrengthen much their petty Commonwealth of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hooker in his Preface of Eccleſ.

The civill regiment of that Towme was popular, and the ſpirituall government, at that time, was at the diſcretion of their Paſtors; it was not for his purpoſe to be at the mercy of either Layty, or Clergy; neither could his ambition and pride brooke any ſuch ſubjection. Wherefore after they had taken the oath which he exacted, ſeeing it was impoſſible to make himſelfe Biſhop (the very name being odious, and the reality much more in <hi>Geneva,</hi> having annexed to it an abſolute dominion over that State) he framed his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to the humour of the people in outward ſhew, making it plauſible by compoſing his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Court, or Conſiſtory of lay Elders, double in number to the Miniſters; whereby all would be at his owne diſpoſall; becauſe the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> though more in number, were changed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very yeare, and would not dare to oppoſe the Miniſters that continued in office, and theſe were all his owne Creatures; ſo that all ſerved for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Conſiſtory, but to countenance and put in execution <hi>Calvins</hi> decreer. He ſate in his Eccleſiaſticall Court more abſolute then any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103652:36"/>having no rule to be guided by, but his owne fancy, and any text of Scripture which he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accommodate to it, the private ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient ground for the moſt impertinent and abſurd application.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It is the opinion of many that <hi>Calvin</hi> was a more politike heretike then <hi>Luther,</hi> and that he ſhewed it in his Religion and diſcipline. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that <hi>Luther</hi> was more learned, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute then <hi>Calvin;</hi> who, if the truth were know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, did but ſteale from <hi>Luther,</hi> even his private ſpirit, to which <hi>Luther</hi> and all Proteſtants recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, when they are preſſed with evidence contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting their errours. His doctrine of denying the reall preſence, and his making worſhip of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages idolatry, he tooke from <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> and his <hi>Camerades;</hi> ſo that all conſidered, we finde, that <hi>Calvin</hi> had but very little, or nothing of his owne in his Religion, but his diſcipline. The reaſon why <hi>Calvin</hi> rejected all ceremonies in his Church, was <hi>Luthers</hi> ill ſucceſſe in admitting and framing ſome. This mad fellow tooke upon himſelfe the authority which he denyed to the Catholick Church, compoſing a Maſſe and ceremonies of his owne, but ſoone repented his folly, when he peruſed <hi>Iodocus Clictoveus</hi> his booke confuting his fond preſumption, to which <hi>Luther</hi> could never anſwer. This made <hi>Calvin</hi> ſo great an enemy of Eccleſiaſticall ceremonies.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Though he hated ceremonies, he coveted miracles, becauſe they are neceſſary to make a new ſenſe of Scripture, and a new private ſpirit prudently credible: his bare word was not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103652:37"/>teſtimony of the truth, without ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall and viſible ſigne to confirme it. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> therefore perſuaded one <hi>Brullen</hi> a Frenchman of his owne Sect in <hi>Geneva,</hi> to feigne himſelfe dead, and when he would bid him riſe in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Religion, ſpirit, and diſcipline, to obey, and tell the ſpectators newes of the other world. The agreement was made, <hi>Brullen</hi> was to have ſo much money, his wife gave her conſent, becauſe ſhe was poore, and they communicated the matter to her, it being impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it from her knowledge. To be briefe, the ſuppoſed death of <hi>Brullen</hi> was publiſhed,<note place="margin">Bolſee c. <hi>11.</hi> Lang c. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> and none lamented it more then <hi>Calvin,</hi> conſidering the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of his wife, and family. Out of meere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion he repaires to the houſe, declaring the affliction of his ſpirit to all who met him, but withall giving them hopes of a miracle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſanctity of his owne life, doctrine, and diſcipline might be made evident. As ſoone as he fixed his eyes upon the ſuppoſed dead Corps, he lifted them up to the Lord, and deſired his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brethren to joyne with him in prayer, that God might command <hi>Brullen</hi> his ſoule returne to his body, and <hi>Calvin</hi> naming him, bid him riſe, and declare to all preſent, Gods ſenſe of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and diſcipline. The wife ſeeing her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band did not riſe, and that really he had ſignes of death in his face, drew nearer, and by experience found that <hi>Brullen</hi> was dead indeed. Whereupon ſhe cryed aloud, and declared to all the people the ſtory, accuſing <hi>Calvin</hi> of being not onely an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, but a murtherer: both he and his friends
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103652:37"/>ſneakt away, and never afterwards attempted to worke miracles, which now he hated as much as ceremonies. Such another miracle doe we read of <hi>Cyrola</hi> the Arrian,<note place="margin">Greg. Tur. <hi>2.</hi> hiſt. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> who by touching the eyes of one who feigned himſelfe blinde, was realy made blinde by that hereticall hand; but <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Catholick Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> reſtored him his ſight againe, by making the ſigne of the croſſe upon his eyes. Theſe Hereticks were rather <hi>Cheates,</hi> then <hi>Politicians;</hi> weake policy doth betray it ſelfe at length, and when it is applyed to the diſcredit of the true Religion, and eſtabliſhment of hereſie, God is ſo much concerned in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of theſe petty plots and tricks, that its impoſſible they ſhould have any effect.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103652:39"/>whereby the Hereticks of the Netherlands came to have ſo honourable a denomination, as their brethren the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in France. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, to be diſcerned from Hereticks, or <hi>Geuſes,</hi> wore alſo medalls about their necks, or tyed to their beads, with the Image of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Saviour on the one ſide, and on the other, his bleſſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If Hereticks thought it was a profeſſion of fidelity, and devotion in themſelves to their King, to weare and worſhip his image, I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould finde fault with Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, for wearing medalls, or worſhipping the images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Mother, and Saints. I am ſure we meane better to God in doing it, then they did to their King, when they were called <hi>Geuſes.</hi> The King of Spaine was not jealous that they would rebell with his image, or make it King, there was no danger of ſuch a foppery. Its a fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and madneſſe in Hereticks, to imagine, that God is jealous of Catholicks worſhipping his owne, or his ſervants images; and as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended danger of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> it is no greater, then that which the <hi>Geuſes</hi> did incurre of ſetting up their medalls for their King, or Earle of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The difference betweene our medalls, and theirs, is, that ours is a profeſſion of love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and devotion, which we beare to God and his Saints, becauſe they are his ſervants: theirs was a pretext of treachery, and rebellion againſt their Soveraigne, who was as farre from their hearts and effections, as his image was neare their breſts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There was never any Prince that did more

                  <p n="5">5 Their forme of making Biſhops is no leſſe deficient then the former. The words are: <hi>Take the holy Ghoſt, and remember that thou ſtirre up the grace of God which is in thee by impoſition of hands, for God hath not given us the ſpirit of feare, but of power, love, and ſoberneſſe.</hi> This advertiſement of Saint <hi>Paul to Timothy,</hi> after he had made him Biſhop, doth ſuppoſe,<note place="margin">2. <hi>ad Tim.</hi> 1.</note> and not give the Order of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; it is an admonition to exerciſe the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not the ordination it ſelfe, becauſe it doth not declare in particular the name or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Biſhop: <hi>Take the holy Ghoſt,</hi> is ſaid to Prieſts, as well as to Biſhops; and the ſpirit of love, power, and ſoberneſſe, is communicated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by Prieſthood. Here is nothing peculiar to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103652:43"/>Epiſcopall Ordination. But the truth is, the Zwinglian Church of England that compoſed theſe formes, made no difference betweene a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe that was the current Doctrine in all reformed Churches in thoſe dayes, and particularly in the Zwinglian;<note place="margin">See the 23. of the 39. articles of the Church of England.</note> a Prieſt, or a Biſhop was he that was appointed by the Congregation to preach their Ghoſpel; it was but an extrinſecall denomination, a meere formality taken from the will of the faithfull bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and from a ſquare <hi>cap,</hi> and a linnen <hi>rochet.</hi> This is made evident by the example of <hi>Iohn Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> who could never be diſpenſed withall by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> in the cap and rochet, when he was to be made Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> though they never troubled him with impoſition of hands, or ordination.<note place="margin">Pag. 1366.</note> 
                     <hi>I cannot tell</hi> (faith <hi>Fox</hi>) <hi>what ſiniſter and unlucky contention, concerning the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſecration of Biſhops, and of their apparrell, with other like trifles, began to diſturb the good and luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky beginning of this godly Biſhop &amp;c. In concluſion he was faine to agree to this condition, t at ſometimes he ſhould in his ſermons ſhew himſelfe apparailed as the other Biſhops were. His upper garment was a long ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let ſhymar downe to the foote: and under that a white linnen rochet, that covered all his ſhoulders. Vpon his head he bad a geometricall or mathematicall cap, that is, a foure ſquared cap, with foure angles, dividing the whole world into foure parts, albeit his head was Round.</hi> You may perceive by this, how little they valued Ordination in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes; all their care was, that the appearance and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour formality of a Biſhop, ſhould be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103652:44"/>becauſe that would maintaine them, and keepe them in poſſeſſion of the Biſhops reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and of a place in the upper Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. All was policy, there was nothing of Religion.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 The change of Religion which the Queene made in England, was by corrupting moſt of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103652:46"/>Nobility, though I belive more of them ſtood for the Catholick Faith then the Earle of <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and Viſcount <hi>Montacute:</hi>

Its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that all the Biſhops did their duty in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the true Faith, and that many of the Nobility were perverted by the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Arundell.</hi> One of 14. Biſhops that were in Parliament, of whom there was an opinion of ſanctity; when he perceived how flexible many of the Lords were to the Queenes deſires in changing the ancient Faith, and eſtabliſhing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy, uttered theſe terrible words: <hi>The curſe of God, and of mine, fall upon your ſelves, and your poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which will be deſtroyed by this very Religion that ye have voted for this day.</hi> Whether this was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, or no, I will not diſpute, but what the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop foretold, is now viſible to the whole world. There is not upon the face of the earth a more contemptible generation of men, then the Engliſh Nobility at this preſent. One ſimple Souldiour, or <hi>Read-coate,</hi> is ſufficient to keepe them all in awe, and three or foure Troopers may diſarme three hundred, and be more uncivill if they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. If Catholick Religion had ſtood, the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had never fallen from their ancient ſplendour, they had beene as famous abroad, and beloved at home, as their renowned Anceſtors, who were all Roman Catholicks. Policy never thrives long againſt Religion, and fortunes built upon the

The Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> head of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Polititians, that gathered votes for the Queene and Proteſtancy, loſt his head upon a block, when it was thought he was in hopes to have it crowned, by marrying the Queene of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Many others of the Engliſh Nobility, and Gentry, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They may attribute their owne miſery, and captivity, to the liberty which they gave in that fatall Parliament to the people, of interpreting Scripture as they ſhould thinke fit. It was no leſſe want of Policy, then Religion, not to ſtick to the old Roman infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſeeing they could not make their Enghliſh Church infallible. The Popes ſupremacy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, is not ſo prejudiciall to the world, as Hereticks pretend; it takes away all ryranny, and rebellion, that may be covered with a cloake of Religion, if both Prince and people will ſubmit their judgements to his, who is an indifferent perſon. All England hath reaſon to curſe Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her firſt Parliament, for depriving them of ſo neceſſary a ſupport of the Soveraignes authority, and the Nations liberty, as the Popes ſpirituall juriſdiction and authority.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 After that the Catholick Religion was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted downe in Parliament, the Queene comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all the Catholick Biſhops ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,

See Perſons his third part of the three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of England, cap. 7. n. 62.</note> The Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night before Maſter <hi>Rough</hi> Miniſter of the Congregation in London (who was a Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Friar in Scotland) was taken, being in his bed, he dreamed that he ſaw two of the guard, leading to priſon <hi>Cuthbert Simpſon</hi> Deacon of the ſaid Congregation. Whereupon being ſore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, he awaked, and called his wife, ſaying, <hi>Kate ſtrike light, for I am much troubled with my brother Cuthbert this night.</hi> When ſhe had ſo done, he gave himſelfe to read on his booke. And then feeling ſleepe to come upon him, he put out the candle, and ſo gave himſelfe to reſt againe; but being a ſleepe, he dreamed the like dreame; and awaking therewith, ſaid, <hi>0 Kate, my brother Cuthbert is gone.</hi> And ſo they lighted a candle, and roſe. This is one miracle which <hi>Fox</hi> recounteth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Now ſhall you heare another miracle of <hi>Simpſon</hi> himſelfe, ſet downe alſo in <hi>Fox</hi> his owne words.<note place="margin">Fox pag. 1844.</note> The day before <hi>Simpſon</hi> was condemned (ſaith he) <hi>Cloney</hi> the keeper of his priſon being
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103652:51"/>gone forth, about eleven of the clock towards midnight, <hi>Cuthbert Simpſon</hi> (whether in a ſlumber, or being awaked I cannot ſay) heard one coming in, firſt opening the outward dore, then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, after the third, and ſo looking in to the ſaid <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> having no candle, nor toarch that he could ſee, but giving a brightneſſe and light moſt comfortable and joyfull to his heart, ſaying <hi>Ha</hi> unto him, and ſo departed againe. Who it was, he could not tell, neither dare I define, ſaith <hi>Fox.</hi> But I dare ſay it was <hi>Cloney</hi> the keeper, that came to watch his priſoner with a light in his hand; or perhaps the Proteſtant Deacon dreamed, or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied in the darke that one came in, and ſaid <hi>Ha</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which may paſſe for a Proteſtant ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall viſion and miracle. <hi>Fox</hi> maketh a long diſcourſe why the dreame of a married Friar, and the imagination of <hi>Simpſon</hi> the Deacon, ought to be looked upon, and believed as miraculous; and would have all Catholick viſions miſtruſted and rejected, though never ſo authentically related, or recorded.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 But the greateſt miracle of the Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church, was Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her ſelfe, that embrued her cruell hands in the royall bloud of <hi>Mary Steward,</hi> lawfull heire to the Crowne of England: this Engliſh <hi>Iezabel</hi> not content to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe The Kingdome, deprived her alſo of her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and put to death many noble perſons, that by their innocent bloud ſhe might colour her ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and baſtardy.

In the beginning of her reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne was celebrated that venerable Synod or Nags<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head Miniſters, and reverend coblers, tinkers &amp;c. wherein the Proteſtant Creed of 39. articles was coyned, the greateſt part whereof conſiſts in not believing, and declaring againſt the Catholick Religion.

Its ſtrange to ſee, how even to this day, Proteſtant Miniſters doe extoll this Queene, as if ſhe were the patterne of Religion and chaſtity.

                  <p n="1">1 KIng <hi>Iames</hi> had too much wit to be of <hi>Calvins</hi> Religion; though his education was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Calviniſts, he did perceive that it was not invented for the good of Princes, but rather for their ruine, and that petty Miniſters and poore Elders might beare the ſway in Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103652:53"/>Biſhops corrupted, and altered the ſaid Tranſlation made by King <hi>Iames</hi> his order. This was to transforme the very Scripture into Policy, and ſlight both conſcience and Religion. Let any ſober perſon judge, how ſcrupulous would Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Abbots</hi> be, and the other pretended Biſhops in his time, to forge and falſify <hi>Maſons</hi> Records, to the end they might make good impoſition of hands at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> when ſo impudently and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly they corrupted Gods Word, fearing that by force of the text, they ſhould be forced to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> and from thence be lead into Purgatory; but none who dyes in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, needs feare going thither. In the ſame Tranſlation they have tranſlated Gal. 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, ſo that ye cannot doe the things ye would;</hi> whereas the Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin is, <hi>Ye doe not (de facto) the things ye would.</hi> And to prove their hereſy averring a neceſſity, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precept for all perſons to receive both kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des 1.

They falſely tranſlate thus, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eate this bread, (and) drinke this cup of the Lord unworthily &amp;c.</hi> Whereas both in the Latin and Greeke it is, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eate this bread, (or) drinke this chalice &amp;c.</hi> which disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, <hi>or,</hi> cannot inferre the neceſſity of both kindes, as the conjunctive <hi>(and)</hi> might ſeeme to doe both here, and in other places, if by this they were not ſo clearly interpreted. And becauſe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Clergy, even in King <hi>Iames</hi> and his Sonnes reigne, were loath to depart with their wives, though they pretended to be as true Prieſts as the Apoſtles, they did not correct the falſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103652:54"/>of 1. Cor. 1. <hi>Have not we power to lead about a wife?</hi> as if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had one, and the reſt of the Apoſtles; they notwithſtanding put in King <hi>Iames</hi> his Tranſlation <hi>woman</hi> in the margen, but <hi>wife</hi> remained in the text. They did not correct the corrupting of 2. Pet. 1. <hi>Labour that by good workes you make ſure your vocation, and election:</hi> they leave out <hi>good workes,</hi> as they have done alſo in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> tranſlations, though it be in all the Latin and in the moſt authentike Greeke copies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It were tedious to mention all the falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Engliſh tranſlations of Scripture, and theſe I hope are ſufficient to prove, that in King <hi>Iames</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> reigne, there was as little Religion in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as in Queene <hi>Elizabeths.</hi> Scripture was made ſpeake whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Courtiors and Polititians fancied and deſired. It was ridiculous to ſee how the Church did on a ſuddaine accommodate it ſelfe to the Court, and how <hi>Bancroft</hi> pretended Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> after of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> did write and preach for Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, as a diſtinct order of Prieſthood, in King <hi>Iames</hi> his reigne, whereas a little before he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Maſter <hi>William Alabuſter</hi> (when he obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that no Biſhop laid hands,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4 Before King <hi>Iames</hi> was in poſſeſſion of the Crowne of England, he was engaged to many
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103652:54"/>Princes that he would eaſe Catholicks by repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the penall Lawes, and without doubt had performed, if he had not beene diverted from it by <hi>Cecil,</hi> and other upſtarts and Polititians, whoſe intereſt was begunne and grounded upon hereſy, and the deſtruction of the ancient Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdome. There was a treaty of peace betweene him and the King of Spaine, whoſe Ambaſſadour in <hi>London</hi> had in his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to inſiſt upon liberty of conſcience for Catholicks, and the King was reſolved to grant it, rather then to breake of the treaty, and told <hi>Cecil</hi> ſo much; who undertooke to the King, that he would make peace with the Spaniard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any obligation to favour Catholicks, adviſing his Majeſty to oblige his owne Subjects, and not to permit them to owe ſo great an obligation to the King of Spaine, or any other forreigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. <hi>Cecil</hi> therefore deales with an Italian Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, by whom the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour was to by adviſed in all his negotiation, and tells him that King <hi>Iames,</hi> and himſelfe alſo, were as willing to grant liberty of conſcience to Catholicks, as the Catholick King was earneſt in demanding it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not onely juſt, but convenient for the State, Catholicks being the fitteſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to oppoſe Puritaniſme, which the King ſo much did feare and hate; therefore they ſhould have liberty of conſcience; but it was not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, or poſſible to article concerning any ſuch thing; becauſe the Kingdome would be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Subjects would owe the favour to the King of Spaine, not to their owne, who was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103652:55"/>reſolved within a little time to repeale all penall Lawes. Whether the Italian believed <hi>Cecil,</hi> I Knowe not, but its certaine that theſe two Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians reſolved, no mention ſhould be made of Religion in the articles: notwithſtanding King <hi>Iames,</hi> being of a gracious diſpoſition, told <hi>Cecil,</hi> he would not perſecute for conſcience the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; and I believe, would have beene very moderate, if <hi>Cecil</hi> had not invented the Gun-pouder treaſon plot. That <hi>Cecil</hi> was the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or at leaſt the fomenter of it, was teſtified by one of his owne domeſtick Gentlemen, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed a certaine Catholick his friend, by name Maſter <hi>Buck</hi> two moneths before, of a wicked deſigne his Maſter had againſt Catholicks: one Maſter <hi>Treſham,</hi> and another Catholick, who were thought to have beene <hi>Cecils</hi> inſtruments in all this buſineſſe, having acceſſe to him even at midnight, were ſent to the Tower, and never ſeene afterwards, leaſt they ſhould tell tales; and its very certain that <hi>Percy,</hi> and <hi>Catesby</hi> might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve beene taken alive, when they were killed; but <hi>Cecil</hi> knew full well, that theſe two unfortunate Gentlemen would have related the ſtory leſſe to his owne advantage, then himſelfe cauſed it to be publiſhed: therefore they were diſpatched when they might have beene made priſoners, having no other weapons offenſive, or defenſive, but their ſwords.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 This wicked plot of <hi>Cecil</hi> made the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks ſo odious, that it was not in the Kings power to doe them his intended favour; yet whether it was, that he ſuſpected <hi>Cecils</hi> knavery, or that he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103652:55"/>would not have the crime of few men attributed to their Religion, and to the multitude, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he innocency of both, and did not perſecute Catholicks as much as Proteſtants deſired; yet the barrells wherein the pouder was, are kept as reliques, and were often ſhewed to the King, and his poſterity, that they might not entertaine the leaſt thought of clemency towards Catholick Religion. There is not an ignorant Miniſter, or Tub-preacher, who doth not (when all other matter failes) remit his Auditors to the Gun-pouder treaſon, and deſcribe theſe tubs very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically the onely reliques thought fit by them to be kept in memory. They might have kept other monuments of farre more barbarous, ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge cruelty, whereunto none but themſelves can lay claime, practiſed by the French and Scotch <hi>Hugonots,</hi> ſo horridly foule and abominable, not onely to the thoughts, but eyes of men, that it is a ſhame to Chriſtianity, to ſee it degenerate by <hi>hereſy,</hi> to more ugly, enormous outrages, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver humane nature could be tranſported into by the fury of <hi>Paganiſme.</hi> I forbeare the bloudy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of England in Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> time, as not ſo barbarous in appearance, though more wicked in ſubſtance, as being exhibited by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Magiſtrates under the colour of Law and pretext of peace of the Land; the ſtarving and racking of ſo many innocent, worthy, learned perſons; the tearing out of hearts and bowels in the publike view upon ſuborned teſtimonies of baſe, vagabond, perjured catchpoules, hired to ſweare what they and their hirers knew to be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103652:56"/>falſe, and all the world ſawe to be voyd of all ſignes of truth. But to returne to <hi>Cecil,</hi> the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe contrived by him, was imputed to men that had no more hand in the plot, then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade their penitents from it in confeſſion; the ſeale whereof is ſo ſacred, that it cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; which obligation of ſecrecy, is of greater aduantage to prevent treaſon, then if it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to reveale the miſchiefe imparted in that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe none will confeſſe a treaſon, that he thinks may be revealed; and by acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Confeſſour with treacherous purpoſes, he may be diſſwaded from them, but not abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unleſſe he doth promiſe to deſiſt, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily repent. It was foretold to <hi>Cecil</hi> that the hand of God would fall heavily upon him, and that he ſhould dye in a <hi>ditch,</hi> and be burried in a <hi>dunghill;</hi> a thing very unlikely to happen, all circumſtances conſidered, and yet it happened; for, being jealous of my Lord <hi>Henry Howards</hi> getting into the Kings favour, <hi>Cecil</hi> made ſuch haſt from the <hi>Bath</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> (notwithſtanding a troubleſome diſeaſe) that going to eaſe himſelfe in a ditch, there he dyed, and was afterwards burried in a Chappell, that himſelfe had built upon a dunghill. And thus a man raiſed from durt, came to be diſſolved into his owne element, and to reſt in his native ſoile. Not onely Catholicks, but Proteſtants, have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon To curſe the memory of this man, and his gun-pouder plot; for, if Catholicks had beene counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, as King <hi>Iames</hi> intended, Puritans, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sectaries would never have had the power to bring his Sonnes head to the block, and the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103652:56"/>Nation to ſo much bloudſhead. Let Polititians ſay what they pleaſe, there is no greater ſupport of Monarchy, then Catholick Religion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Though in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, Religion was ſquared to his Majeſties intereſt and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alwayes with ſome regard to that which had beene formerly profeſſed in Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> dayes, for feare of cauſing a diſtemper by a ſuddaine alteration; yet in King <hi>Charles</hi> his reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, the Church of England came to that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that it profeſſed no Religion at all. Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants had beene ſo ſhamefully beaten from all their negative articles, and lurking holes, by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Divines, that they were forced to doe what petty Princes are accuſtomed, when they are oppreſſed, and overpowred by great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs confining with their Eſtates; now they ſide with <hi>France,</hi> now with <hi>Spaine,</hi> becauſe they are not able to ſtand upon their owne legs. When the petty Church of England cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it ſelfe againſt Catholick arguments, then they ſide with Puritans, or any others, that will take them into protection; and when Puritans, and other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hereticks reject them, then they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the ſame thing with us, and goe by the name of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which becommeth them as ill, and no leſſe ridiculouſly, then Spaniſh attire doth a Frenchman. The title of <hi>ſupreme Head of the Church,</hi> ſo ſpiritualized in Queene <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> that ſhe diſpenſed with all invalidities of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in King <hi>Iames,</hi> that he diſpenſed with <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats</hi> of Canterbury his <hi>irregularity,</hi> (when ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a <hi>Buck,</hi> he killed a man) was in King <hi>Charles</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103652:57"/>his dayes limited onely to temporall affaires, and all ſpirituall functions declared to he out of the <hi>ſupremacies</hi> reach and clement. But rather then it ſhall be reſtored back againe to the Pope, ſome of their chiefe Doctors beſtow it upon the Sea of Saint <hi>David,</hi> or ſome other Welch Biſhoprick, by reaſon of their obſtinacy againſt Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the Apoſtle of the Saxons, who commanded the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Brittans to accommodate themſelves to the Roman Church in celebrating Eaſter, wherein alone they differed from it. And the maine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now alleaged for the old <hi>Brittains,</hi> or <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> independency of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a <hi>Welch</hi> proverbe, which for my ignorance of the langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge I cannot explaine, but onely aſſure you, that it was no more then a Welch proverbe, and in all likelyhood of late date ſince the beginning of moderne hereſies.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Other Doctors of the Engliſh Church thinking it more for their honour and intereſt, to have an independent Patriarch rather at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> then in <hi>Wales,</hi> were eager to comply with Maſter <hi>Lauds</hi> ambition, by whom they might be exempted from dependence of <hi>Rome,</hi> (whence for themſelves they could expect no preferment) and exalted above the deſpicable and miſerable tribe of Puritanicall penſionary Miniſters.

Whereupon ſeeing themſelves engaged to fall under the Cenſure of the Councells of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> which were as univerſall as by all humane induſtry could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly (conſidering the circumſtances of time) be procured, and were as univerſally accepted (as to points of doctrine) as can be required, and with much leſſe oppoſition, then ſome of the firſt foure, which Proteſtants themſelves are pleaſed to accept of; there was no other remedy left to ſhuune their returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> (where they knew there was more wit, then to truſt men of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103652:58"/>no Religion in Eccleſiaſticall government) but to frame a <hi>Chimaera</hi> of a Councell morally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, conſiſting of a joynt Aſſembly of thoſe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,</hi> and ſubordinate Churches, which for their long education in confeſſed hereſy, and ſtrict ſubjection to the Turkes tyranny, (a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous enemy of Chriſtian Aſſemblies) were ſure never to be got together; in the meane time (which time they confided would ſerve their turne) they perſwaded the people to a ſuperficiall acquieſcence in the publick government, and thereby in themſelves, without any regard to the ſubſtance of interiour intellectuall Faith and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of judgement, whereupon the worke of our ſalvation is built.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 They were no leſſe cautious in avoyding the Cenſure of generall Councells, then in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that Doctrine which they pretended might onely be cenſured, being reſolved to have two ſtrings to their bowe. Upon this ſcore they admit, and abſurdly apply the diſtinction of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſtian Religion into <hi>fundamentall,</hi> and <hi>not fundamentall;</hi> and to call that alone a <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> article of Faith, which no Heretick ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103652:58"/>ſome ſchoole ſpeculations, rather impertinent then profitable, or neceſſary. Hence you may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Proteſtant Church of England is more beholding to their Neighbours for the little they yet retaine of Chriſtian Religion, then to their owne Doctors and Preachers; the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and conſent of believers in ſome generall points of Chriſtianity, is the motive of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and therefore its meerly hiſtoricall, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon humane perſuaſion, and not upon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall inſpiration. If Proteſtants had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed as frequently and familiarly with Turkes, and Jewes, as with Chriſtians, the myſteries of the Trinity and Incarnation would be eſteemed no more neceſſary, or fundamentall, then that of Tranſubſtantiation. Truly <hi>Mahomets</hi> ſtory of his familiar commerce with the holy Ghoſt in the ſhape of a <hi>Dove,</hi> is every jot as probable, as <hi>Luthers</hi> extraordinary vocation to reforme the Doctrine of the Church; or <hi>Calvins</hi> fantaſticall private ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and would be no leſſe credited by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, if to them it were as frequently and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly recounted: they would content themſelves with believing, that there is but one God, Creator, and Remunerator of mankinde.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 This want of ſupernaturall Faith, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, was not diſcovered by many, who were much taken with the exteriour formalities and ſplendour of the Engliſh Proteſtant Church, which looked as freſh and faire as the aples of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> thougb in the inſide all was traſh and aſhes; it was a well adorned ſepulchre of dead ſoules, without Faith, ſtuffed with ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Hereſy being thus raiſed to its greateſt height, and moſt part of the Engliſh Proteſtant Doctors being of no Religion at all, it was time for Gods vengeance to fall upon their Church, which in King <hi>Charles</hi> his reigne was but a fancy of Chriſtianity, indifferent for all hereſies, and in that ſenſe onely, <hi>Catholick,</hi> or univerſall, it was an <hi>

Hereupon <hi>Henry</hi> declares warre againſt Scotland, and <hi>Iames</hi> the V. raiſes an Army to oppoſe and prevent <hi>Henry,</hi> by making England the Seate of the warre: But becauſe he named a Favorite of his owne to command the Army under himſelfe, that was not gratefull to the Nobility and people, they would not obey, nor concurre with their Soveraigne according to their duty. This put the King into a feaver,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103652:60"/>whereof he dyed the 13. of December 1542. in the 32. yeare of his age; a moſt gallant and active Prince, whole greateſt fault and ruine was, not to diſtinguiſh betweene the <hi>duty</hi> and the <hi>humour</hi> of his Subjects: a wiſe Prince muſt ſo contrive things, that the one be ſeconded by the other; for, if they encounter, its twenty to one, but the humour of a multitude will prevaile againſt the duty they owe to their Soveraigne, who muſt humour his people, if he will be obeyed, and goe their pace, if he will be ſerved his owne way; but let him endeavour to make it appeare, that he hath away of his owne, and that he is not at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of others, who are hated, or not regarded by thoſe that muſt doe his buſineſſe: when Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects imagine that they are not governed by their Prince, but by his Favorites, they often breake out into open rebellion, eſpecially if the Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites ſeeme to be too imperious and uncivill. It were to be wiſhed that the people did accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves to the humour or their Prince, and his Councellours; and not impoſſible, if the Prince will chooſe perſons of honour and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, to aſſiſt him that confound not their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters intereſt with their owne ambition and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Whether the King of Scots his Favorite was guilty of any ſuch crime, I knowe not, but his caſe hath demonſtrated to poſterity, that nothing can be more fatall to a Prince, then to ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the humour of his Subjects for a Favorite, whoſe fidelities they ſuſpect, or contemne his perſon and abilities. And if Kings will thinke it concerns their honour, not to part with hated or
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103652:61"/>contemned Favorits, becauſe thereby they ſeeme to condemne their owne choice and judgements; let them conſider, whether it be more for their purpoſe to be deprived of their Kingdomes, or to acknowledge that they are men, and may be miſtaken in chooſing Councellors and <hi>Privados.</hi> Yet if the Councellors grew odious ſince they ſate at the helme, the caſe is altered, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce his choice, or judgement cannot be cenſured for removing from the management of affaires perſons, whoſe incapacity was not knowne to him, before he applyed them to the government of the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 But in caſe the unfitneſſe of a Favorite for governing great affaires, ſhould be ſo evident, that the ill ſucceſſe muſt be attributed rather to his want of wiſdome and conduct, then to fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: if the Prince be obſtinate in his reſolution of not parting with him, he muſt runne the hazard of being cenſured not onely void of judgement in his choice, but alſo incorrigible in his errours; his firſt choice may be excuſed by affection to the perſon, or want of experience; his perſiſting in that choice (notwithſtanding the continuall miſcarriage of buſineſſes) muſt be attributed to an incapacity of learning (even by experience) the art of governing. Therefore it concerns not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtate, but alſo the honour of Princes, to condemne ſometimes their owne firſt choice and judgements, by ſecond thoughts and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, leaſt the world ſhould thinke, that they are more wilfull then underſtanding, more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted upon an unhappy Favorite, then attentive
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103652:61"/>to the common good, their owne intereſt and reputation. This leſſon was inculcated to the late King <hi>Charles</hi> by his Father, when he charged him to beware of Maſter <hi>Laud,</hi> whom King <hi>Iames</hi> did foreſee to be as unfit for government, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he proved, by treating the Engliſh Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry with ſuch ſcorne, as if they were borne to be no leſſe under his command, then <hi>de facto</hi> they were at his diſpoſall, by reaſon of the Kings favour and commiſſion. Had his late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty beene as fortunate in taking his Fathers advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce as his Father was prudent in giving it, their poſterity, and the poore Cavalleers, had beene in a better condition. Princes are not ſo frequently ruined by their owne faults, as by their Favorits, unleſſe you will reckon amongſt their owne, whatſoever is owned by them to excuſe their Miniſters. Yet politick Princes are more apt to father their owne overſights upon others, then adopt thoſe of others to themſelves; and are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſo conſtant in their affection to Favorits, as for their ſakes to bring their owne judgements in queſtion, either by owning their defects, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their miſgovernment.</p>

Biſhop of Rome ſent the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> to comfort the Scots in their affliction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to be conſtant in that Faith which they had inherited from their Anceſtours.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 By the ſermons of Friar <hi>William,</hi> and the liberty of reading the <hi>Bible,</hi> many of the vulgar ſort, and alſo of the Nobility, were perverted; and becauſe Cardinal <hi>Beton,</hi> being Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> and Chancellor of Scotland, was an obſtacle to their intended rebellion, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Catholick Religion, they did aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him in his owne chamber, and hanged his body out at the window in his Cardinals robes.

               <p n="1">1 WHat a great hand <hi>Policy</hi> had in deſtroying <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſetting up <hi>Reformation,</hi> hath beene demonſtrated in the former Chapter and Sections.

                  <hi>Quakers;</hi> though now many ſilly ſoules doe reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their memories, becauſe diſtance of time makes things looke as unlike themſelves, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place. A brute beaſt, at a diſtance, may be taken for a rationall creature; and a beaſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation may, by the helpe of time and policy, gaine the credit of a rationall Religion amongſt miſinformed and weake underſtandings; but it can never looke like <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> Faith, to any rationall perſon, that will examine the grounds and fundation of it, notwithſtanding that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Clergy and Polititians have endeavoured to dabe it over with the private ſpirit, and their owne interpretation of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There is the ſame proportion betweene Catholick Religion and Reformation, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ancient Gentry and upſtarts. Kings, out of policy, or favour, may beſtowe titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but all the policy upon earth, cannot make a man an ancient Gentleman, if he be not one by deſcent. A Nobleman that derives his pedigree from Citizens, cannot compare in quality with men, whoſe Anceſtors have beene, time out of memory, knowne Gentlemen. Its juſt ſo in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions. Men may give to their Reformations very glorious titles, as <hi>Mount Sion, Aſſembly of Saints, Beauteous diſcipline,</hi> and what they pleaſe; but all will not doe. The ancient name of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> comes by deſcent, and continuall ſucceſſion, not by policy, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and not to any other, pretending Reformation. Theſe new Religions may well become <hi>upſtarts,</hi> and new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies raiſed by hereſy: but methinks the ancient
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103652:67"/>Nobility and Gentry looke odly in this new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned faith, and ſeeme to ſtaine their bloud, by renouncing and perſecuting that Religion, which their noble Progenitors for ſo many ages did conſtantly profeſſe, and gloriouſly maintaine, both at home and abroad.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Catholick Religion doth not onely ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſe with ancient Gentry in deſcent and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, but alſo in their Coates of armes. The armes of the Catholick Religion, are the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ſignes of the true Church, viſible to the world. Put caſe that a <hi>Cheate,</hi> or <hi>Mountebanck</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed like a Gentleman, ſhould intrude himſelfe into the company of perſons of quality in <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> and brag much of his Gentry; but when he is deſired to prove it he ſhould ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that he hath no other evidence for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, but certaine interiour motions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes to heroike actions; queſtionleſſe this <hi>Mountebank</hi> would be laught at by the whole company. This is the caſe of all reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that pretend to be the true one, or part thereof, without any further proofe or evidence for their Religion, and interpretation of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, then their owne word for a private ſpirit, as inviſible in it ſelfe, as in any effect that lookes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſupernaturall. Its true, that many noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whoſe Anceſtors have beene lions (as their Coates of armes teſtify even to this day) have by degrees degenerated into lambes; yet they prove by tradition and records, that they deſcend from warlike lions. Though the Roman Catholick Church had no miracles, nor perſons of eminent
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103652:67"/>ſanctity of life at the preſent, to ſhew for their Religion; that onely of their Anceſtors in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, would be proofe enough, that they profeſſe the right Faith; becauſe they have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of tradition, and records, that it is the ſame with the Faith of thoſe, who worked miracles, and were Saints: but reformed Churches want all ſuch evidences; and though records may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Maſter <hi>Maſon,</hi> and others of the Engliſh Church; neither they, nor any private ſpirit can, by all their politick deviſes, counterfeit <hi>tradition,</hi> which muſt goe further up into antiquity, then they can reach by all humane induſtry. But (the Lord be praiſed for it) the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church hath now, and had in every age evident miracles, and eminent ſanctity of life, much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of the Apoſtles, and our primitive Fathers, whereby our ſpirit and faith is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be truly <hi>Catholick.</hi> Theſe armes and ſignes of Gods Church cannot be counterfeited by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, becauſe they are ſupernaturall, and above the ſpheare of hypocriſy and policy. A Puritan may ſhew the white of his eyes, by lifting them up to the Lord, and looke very demurely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly: a <hi>Nags-head</hi> Miniſter may walke in <hi>roba longa,</hi> and weare his ſupliſe, black ſcarfe, and ſquare cap: but none of them can attaine to an eminent degree of ſupernaturall ſanctity, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a miracle, untill they forſake the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and become Roman Catholicks.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The pretended evidence of Scripture, in favour of Reformation, is not leſſe ridiculous then the private ſpirit. Let us track our <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:103652:68"/>Gentleman, and follow him to the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> after his being repulſed, and laught at in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> for proving his Nobility onely by interiour impulſes. Suppoſe he ſhould in the open Court lay claime to ſome ancient Gentlemans inheritance, deſcended from father to ſonne, for many ages; and ſhould produce no other eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, or proofe, for this pretended right, but his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries owne patent, in vertue whereof the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Gentlemans Anceſtors and himſelfe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the eſtate; but becauſe ſome words in the patent may be interpreted by the <hi>Mountebanks</hi> ambition and coveteouſneſſe in a different ſenſe, then ever they were before that time underſtood by the learned Judges of the Land; our <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank</hi> muſt needs be the right heire, and diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the Gentleman of his ancient inheritance, by miſinterpreting the words of the patent abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and contrary to their knowne ſenſe, and to ſentences and practiſe of the Court, ſince ever Law was of force in England. This is the caſe of all Proteſtants, who pretend that there are cleare texts of Scripture againſt Catholick Tenets and practiſes. The ſenſe of Scripture which we Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks follow, either for <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, communion of the layty</hi> under one kinde, <hi>worſhip of images,</hi> &amp;c. was never contradicted by any, that were not knowne, and judged Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks by the Catholick Church of thoſe times wherein our Tenets were queſtioned: this our ſenſe of Scripture hath miracles to confirme it, and other ſupernaturall ſignes; theirs is backt onely by hereticall obſtinacy and impudence,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103652:68"/>pretending evidence of Scripture in obſcurity, and light in darkneſſe. If all <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> had beene in times paſt, and were at this preſent <hi>idiots,</hi> or naturall fooles, Proteſtants might perſwade them, that they doe not ſee what is cleare and evident in Scripture, in behalfe of Proteſtancy: but untill Reformers prove, that we are all idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, or reſolved to be damned by contradicting Gods cleare Word, they cannot ground their Reformation upon the clearneſſe of Scripture, nor reject that ſenſe of it, which Catholicks we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in poſſeſſion of, before their Sects were heard of in the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That Scripture is not cleare for Proteſtants, is evident, becauſe Catholicks who underſtand it as well as they, differ from them in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. And in caſe it be obſcure to both, its cleare that the tradition and practiſe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Catholick Church, is a better Interpreter of Gods meaning, then any Proteſtant pleaſure, policy, or fancy. Its as unreaſonable therefore to diſpoſſeſſe Catholicks of their ancient Tenets, and ſenſe of Scripture, upon the ſcore of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant interpretation, as it is to diſpoſſeſſe a Gentleman of his ancient inheritance, at the ſuite of a coveteous and impudent <hi>Mountebank,</hi> that can produce no other evidence for his pretence, then his fond interpretation of the very wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, in vertue whereof the Gentleman and his Anceſtors have beene confirmed in the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poſſeſſion of their eſtate, by the ſentence of all Courts in former ages; and never oppoſed, but by ſuch as were convinced and condemned
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103652:69"/>of manifeſt knavery. Here I need not mention, how many times Proteſtant Judges condemne their Religion in their owne Courts, by juſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: whenſoever they judge according to the Lawes of the Land, interpreted by the ancient and continuall practiſe of the Courts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the fancy of ignorant and abſurd plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they give ſentence againſt <hi>Protestancy</hi> for the Roman Catholick Religion, though in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubject; whereby it is evident, how little beholding <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> is to that <hi>Policy,</hi> which is not able to defend reformed Churches in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proteſtant Courts. That Religion is farre from ſupernaturall appearance, which hath not the leaſt colour of naturall equity. But now let us ſee, how little beholding <hi>Policy</hi> is to <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> and prove</p>

               <p n="1">1 <hi>POlicy</hi> without <hi>Religion</hi> is a body without a ſoule. The motions of a politike body muſt have their beginning from Religion, becauſe without it, the Princes and Magiſtrates are too weak for the managing of ſo great a machine as a Commonwealth. The power of the people muſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103652:69"/>be employed againſt themſelves, and the multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de muſt be ſubdued, and kept in ſubjection by their owne forces: all the difficulty and policy conſiſts in perſuading men to a thing ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their naturall inclinations. Some greater power muſt be inculcated; and becauſe that is not viſible, the very Pagans thought it neceſſary, to create a beliefe in their Subjects of inviſible Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to which both Prince and Subjects profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed obedience; being convinced in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that all policy is weake without power, either reall or imagined, to back it, and that the beſt States-man is he, who can perſuade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he is more powerfull then themſelves. This is the reaſon why Polititians, though Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, perſecute <hi>Atheiſme;</hi> becauſe if the multitude thinke, that there is no ſuch thing as God, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other life, they will ſoone diſcover their owne ſtrength, and apply it againſt Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, without feare of being overpowerd by the inviſible hand of God in whom they doe not believe, but fancy to be impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Atheiſts and Proteſtants (being ſworne brothers, and judging of others by themſelves) are of opinion, that the Roman Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is but a politick invention, to ſet up the <hi>Pope,</hi> and enrich the Roman Clergy, by <hi>Purgatory, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, Maſſe,</hi> and <hi>pilgrimages to Images.</hi> If the Roman Catholick Laity were as apt to be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as Proteſtants thinke the Roman Clergy apt and inclined to cheate, their opinion would be more plauſible: but whoſoever will reflect upon the manifeſt miracles and ſupernaturall ſignes,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103652:70"/>whereby theſe and all Catholick Tenets have beene in former ages, and even in this preſent, confirmed; and moreover will conſider, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely many Roman Catholicks of the Layty (moſt prudent and politick men) have examined the grounds of our Religion, and how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, that ſo many former ages, different inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and oppoſite Nations and families, ſhould all concurre and conſpire, to maintaine for Head of the Catholick Church a man they never knew nor expect any benefit by: whoſoever, I ſay, will reflect upon theſe things, will clearly ſee, and be convinced, that no humane policy can reach ſo farre, nor ſecrecy be ſo well kept, that amongſt ſo many millions of perſons, the cheate and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery ſhould not breake out, and never hitherto be diſcovered to Proteſtants, that are no leſſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to knowe it, then vaine in imagining ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous a foppery. But in caſe they are reſolved to be as obſtinate in this mad fancy, as in their other hereſies, they muſt grant, that we have better ſucceſſe in our politick ends, then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and if they will needs call us <hi>knaves,</hi> they cannot thinke we are <hi>fooles;</hi> whereas they may to their owne firſt Reformers, without injury, attribute both denominations; becauſe they ſhewed ſo little wit in framing their new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, that they made them as inconſiſtent with government, as inſeparable from <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the very intereſt they intended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote by reformation.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Atheiſts and Proteſtants doe agree in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God, and in being refractory againſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103652:70"/>ſupreme authority; but with this difference, that the Atheiſt declares againſt God himſelfe, the Proteſtant againſt his Church, which is Gods Liutenant upon earth. He that rebells againſt the Kings Liutenant, will ſoone declare againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and this is the reaſon we ſee ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants become Atheiſts, and of no Religion. As rebellions growe to a height by degrees, firſt they point at evill Counſellours, then at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite, at length at the Kings perſon; ſo Atheiſme poſſeſſeth mens mindes, firſt by vice, then by Proteſtancy, and at laſt by no Religion. The ground of all Religion, and of obedience both to God and men, is the appearance of a lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and ſoveraignty, adhearing to the perſon that pretends it. If the ſignes of his ſuperiority and juriſdiction be evident, he may challenge an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent right to our obedience and beliefe; we are obliged to honour him according to his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. This ground of Religion and obedience, is equally deſtroyed by <hi>Atheiſme</hi> and <hi>Protestancy.</hi> Though the ſignes of a ſupreme Deity be as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and viſible to the eyes of Atheiſts, as this world and all its creatures, yet they deny obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that ſupreme Deity; and though ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ſignes, as miracles and ſanctity of life, be as evident to the eyes of Proteſtants, in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and no other, as any thing can be, yet they deny obedience to the ſaid Church: both agree in deſtroying that principle, upon which the obligation of beliefe and obedience is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Policy and civill government can as little ſtand without this principle, as a houſe can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103652:71"/>out a foundation. Atheiſts and Proteſtants doe agree in undermining not onely Religion, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the authority of Princes and Commonwealths; and therefore both doctrines ought to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibited and ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4 In one reſpect <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to civill government, then <hi>Atheiſme.</hi> An A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt expects not any inviſible power provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſupport him, becauſe he believeth none: a Proteſtant perſuades himſelfe, that God will ſecond his zeale for the Ghoſpel, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is more reſolute and daring; if God (to puniſh the ſinnes of others) permits a Proteſtant to have good ſucceſſe in his firſt attempts, he thinks that ſucceſſe is a new engagement to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further, looking upon himſelfe as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of providence, to carry on the imaginary worke or the Lord. The Atheiſt thinks of no ſuch providence or engagement, but attributeth his ſucceſſe to his owne induſtry, and is not ſo fierce, conſtant, and dangerous an enemy to the civill government, as a Proteſtant. Though all this had not beene evident by reaſon as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily following out of Proteſtant principles, yet its manifeſt by experience and hiſtory, as we have ſeene in this Treatiſe Chap. 7. but becauſe in the next I am to treate of the tyranny and rebellions of Proteſtancy, I will end this with onely aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Reader, that Polititians were never more unhappy, or more groſely miſtaken, then in the beginning and promoting a pretended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that doth not onely lead men to <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> but makes them incapable of being governed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103652:71"/>they have ſhaken of the yoke of obedience to divine Authority, appearing more ſufficiently and evidently in the Roman Catholick Church, then any Kings authority doth appeare in his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or ſubordinate Officers.

               <argument>
                  <p>That <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> inclines the Prince to Tyranny, and the Subjects to Rebellion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 PRinces may be Tyrants, though the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſſe be good; but that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion cannot be good which inclines Princes to tyranny. A Tyrant is he who rules either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or againſt Law, making his owne will and pleaſure the modell of his government. To rule againſt the knowne and practiſed ſenſe of the Law, is to rule againſt Law, becauſe the eſſence of a Law conſiſts in the ſenſe, not in the letter. The fundamentall Lawes of a Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, are the holy Scriptures: to rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the knowne and practiſed ſenſe of theſe Lawes, is the greateſt tyranny, becauſe it is to rule without and againſt Law: it is to rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law, becauſe Gods ſenſe is left out, and the Reformers fancy, or the Prince his pleaſure is thruſt into its place; and Scripture is not Gods Law without Gods ſenſe. It is alſo to rule againſt Law, becauſe the Proteſtant ſenſe of Scripture is contrary to the knowne and practiſed ſenſe of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103652:72"/>Gods Word, whereby the Church hath beene governed ſince the time of the Apoſtles. This proves nothing leſſe then I ſuppoſed in the title of the Chapter: it demonſtrates clearly, that when Proteſtant Princes are not Tyrants, we may thanke themſelves, and not their Religion, which is directly oppoſite to the Law of God, and inconſiſtent with the duty Princes owe to divine Majeſty; whence alſo it followed, that it is an inclination to Tyranny againſt the Lawes and liberties of the Land; becauſe he that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth without and againſt the Law or God, is in a faire way (and at leaſt inclined) to governe without and againſt the Lawes of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I heare, ſome Doctors of the Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church ſeeme to be much ſcandalized at Maſter <hi>Hobbes</hi> his <hi>Leriathan,</hi> becauſe he attributes ſo much to a Soveraigne, and ſaith that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Subjects may, in the exteriour profeſſion of their Faith, accommodate themſelves with the Prince, whether Turke or Jew. I cannot anſwer for Maſter <hi>Hobbes</hi> his Chriſtianity, but this much I will ſay in his behalfe, that I have not ſeene <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy</hi> better expreſſed, nor more conſequently deduced out of its principles, then in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <hi>Leviathan:</hi> he is a good Proteſtant, and an ill Chriſtian. How can any Proteſtant ſinde fault with Maſter <hi>Hobbes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the 39. articles of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>K.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103652:72"/>a new ſenſe of Scripture, contrary to antiquity and the knowne practiſe of all Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and in particular that of England? Why ſhould they, I ſay, aſſume this unlimited power to themſelves, and deny it to their Soveraigne,<note place="margin">3. Ed. 6.12. 5. Ed. 6.1.</note> and his Counſell? If they examine well, they will finde Maſter <hi>Hobbes</hi> doth no more. And if they acknowledge this great power in ſpirituall affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, to be inherent to the Soveraignes perſon (as they doe,<note place="margin">8.

Doe not the Doctors of the Engliſh Church averre, that from the Popes Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and Headſhip of the Church, muſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follow an Antichriſtian Tyranny, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the prerogative, dominion, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Kings, and the liberty of Subjects; why doe they not inferre die ſame conſequence from the Soveraignes ſupremacy? I am ſure they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute greater power to their Kings, Queenes, and petty Doctors, then Catholicks doe to the Pope, or generall Councells, who according to our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, cannot pare of any thing from the matter and forme of Sacraments, nor alter the ancient ſenſe of Scripture, contrary to tradition and the practiſe of the Catholicks Church: but Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy acknowledgeth all this power to be inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the Kings and Queenes of England, and yet doth confeſſe, that both King and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church may erre againſt Chriſtian Faith in their Reformations: no Subject notwithſtanding
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103652:73"/>muſt ſpeake a word againſt thoſe errours, he muſt accommodate himſelfe to them in all his exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour actions, though he be convinced in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they are againſt Catholick Religion. I would faine knowe in what doth this doctrine of theirs differre from Maſter <hi>Hobbes?</hi> Both agree in the ſubſtance, both grant that men may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their Faith, and deny Chriſtianity, either altogether, or by halfe. <hi>Hobbes</hi> ſaith, Subjects may renounce all Chriſtian Religion by words, ſo they believe in their heart: our Doctors of the Engliſh Church ſay, Subjects may deny ſuch points of Chriſtian Religion, as have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by their Soveraignes. And when the Soveraigne will (if ever that ſhould happen) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all Chriſtianity, and believe no more then Turkes, or Jewes, it evidently followeth out of their principles (though hitherto they durſt not ſay it) that the Subject may doe the ſame by an exteriour acquieſcence, untill the contrary be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in an imaginary generall Councell of their owne making, and morally impoſſible to come together, as hath beene ſaid in the 7. Chapt. ſect. 8. for, what reaſon can they have to accommodate themſelves to their Prince and Church, in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome articles of Chriſtian Religion, and not all? They have none, I am ſure, to be angry with Maſter <hi>Hobbes,</hi> who ſayes nothing, but what they alſo muſt ſay, if they will ſticke and be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to Proteſtant principles, and particularly to the doctrine of the Church of England.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> doth incline the Subject to rebellion againſt his law full Prince, is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103652:73"/>then I wiſh it were by ſo many woefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences. Their Reformation begunne in all places with rebellion, and is like ſo to continue, notwithſtanding the vigilant care of wiſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Counſellours. The reaſon is manifeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its morally impoſſible that the conveniency of the Court ſhould alwayes agree with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the people; and many times the Lawes of the Land (being made to favour both) are not ſo cleare in the behalfe of either. The contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing railed, who muſt decide it? Not the people (ſaith the Prince) becauſe they are Subjects. Not the Prince (ſay the people) becauſe he is a part, and Subject to Gods Law. Both appeale to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the ſole Judge of Proteſtants controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. If the Scripture could ſpeake, and pronounce the ſentence without an Interpreter, all might end in peace and quiet: but amongſt Proteſtants, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subject ſpeakes for Scripture, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for himſelfe. If every man be naturally incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to favour himſelfe, and looke with a partiall eye upon his owne intereſt, its more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Scripture interpreted by the Subjects, will ſecond their owne inclination and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency againſt that of Prince, and Court; neither is it leſſe evident, that the Prince, and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, will not ſubmit their judgements and wills to the finall and <hi>ſcripturall</hi> ſentence of every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſo that the ſword and rebellion muſt end the controverſy in that Religion, where all men are ſupreme Judges and Interpreters of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And though the Prince may endeavour to incorporate the legiſtative power, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103652:74"/>the interpretation of the Lawes of the Land, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne prerogative; the Proteſtant Subjects will oppoſe it, not onely as unreaſonable, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as Antichriſtian pride and tyranny, inconſiſtent with their Euangelicall liberty. They will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this conſequence. If God hath made us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of his divine Law, how can a Creature exclude us from interpreting the Lawes of the Land, wherein we are ſo much concerned, and which ought to be ſubordinate to Scripture? Truly ſeeing no Proteſtant Prince, or Church, doth pretend to be infallible in declaring the true ſenſe of Gods Word, they can hardly condemne the Subjects private interpretation, as contrary to Gods meaning; all their Synodicall Decrees, and legall Declarations againſt the Subjects fancy, or pretended inſpiration in favour of the Prince, will be lookt upon by them who oppoſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, as ſuggeſtions of obſequious Courtiours and flattering Clergy, and the people will ſtick to their owne interpretation of Scripture, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the words of the Apoſtles Act. 5. <hi>God ought to be more obeyed then men.</hi> And if the Prince ſhould declare that their text is but a pretext of rebellion, they will retort his argument, and ſay, that his texts are but pretexts of tyranny, and proclaime him a Rebell againſt God: for, the meaneſt of Proteſtant Subjects with a <hi>Bible</hi> in his hand, is as abſolute as his King with a Scepter, nay more, becauſe he lookes upon the Scepter as ſubordinate to his Bible. Thus you ſee, how the liberty of interpreting Scripture is no leſſe the ground of rebellion, then of Proteſtant Faith;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103652:74"/>and how politick Princes by undermining the ancient Catholick ſenſe of Scripture with new fancies and interpretations, have plotted their owne ruine and their poſterities deſtruction. And that this may appeare yet more evidently, I will endeavour to prove</p>

Experience doth demonſtrate, that the Popes ſpirituall juriſdiction over all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is not ſo dangerous as Proteſtant Lawes and petty Preachers doe pretend.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103652:76"/>The ground of fidelity and obedience due to hereditary Soveraignes, is a conſtant tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he who actually reſignes, is lawfull ſucceſſour to one, whoſe right and juriſdiction was undoubtedly acknowledged; and indeed there cannot be a more rationall and ſecure ground of obedience, then tradition, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſucceſſion of lawfull witneſſes from one age to another. Writings may be counterfeited, <hi>Tradition</hi> cannot, becauſe its impoſſible to ſtop ſo many mouthes as deliver it to poſterity, or to contradict: the teſtimony of whole Provinces and Nations. This is the reaſon why Hereticks can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gaineſay the tradition of the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy: though they deny the ſupremacy it ſelfe, and the truth of that Doctrine; yet they are not ſo madly impudent, as to deny what is evident to all Chriſtendome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, that there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>tradition</hi> when <hi>Luther</hi> revolted from the Church, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Chriſts Vicar</hi> upon earth.

Theſe are but weake and pittifull ſhifts, whereunto Proteſtants are driven, by the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Councells, Fathers, Tradition, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick arguments, contrary to the Tenets and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their brethren of the late Church of England. If the Pope be <hi>exordium unitatis,</hi> he muſt be infallible in deciding the controverſy propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, otherwiſe he will be <hi>exordium diviſionis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no learned perſons will ſubmit their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in matters of Faith to a Judge that may be miſtaken; they will be as farre from his ſentence and thoughts, as from any other; and the unity of Faith (whereof Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeakes) conſiſts more in an unity of thoughts of judgements, then of ſpeech, or exteriour acquieſcence. Such a dumb unity of Faith hath its beginning from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, not Religion.</p>
               <p n="5">5 They excuſe themſelves from the guilt and crime of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> as ridiculouſly as they impugne the Popes ſupremacy. They accuſe us Catholicks for the fault themſelves committed, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth they left not our communion, untill we thruſt them out of doores. It may be as well ſaid, that the Judge, and not the thiefe, is the malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, becauſe the Judge pronounced ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the thiefe. The Roman Catholick Church had no more part in the Schiſme of England,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103652:77"/>then to declare <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. and Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the crime, and the Pope pronounced the ſentence. <hi>Therefore the Roman Church, or Court, is guilty of Schiſme,</hi> is an excellent Proteſtant conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence! But ſuch fopperies we muſt expect from obſtinate Hereticks, that with a perverſe will oppoſe no leſſe their owne underſtandings, then Catholick verities. The Pope (ſay they) impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed new articles of Faith upon their tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, he made a new <hi>Creed,</hi> and declared it was neceſſary to believe the ſame. Therefore he was cauſe of the Schiſme. The ſame argument that the <hi>Arrians</hi> made againſt the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his <hi>Creed,</hi> doe theſe Hereticks now object againſt the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Pope <hi>Pius V.</hi> his profeſſion of Faith. Declarations againſt new hereſies, are no new Creeds; they are but explanations of the old, not new articles of Faith. One article of Faith may be divided into many branches: how many doth Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſet downe in his Symbol of the Trinity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation? The Catholick Church did alwayes practiſe this way, when it was neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute hereſies. If it was lawfull for the Church of the fourth age, to command all Chriſtians to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and believe the <hi>Symbol</hi> of Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which was but an explanation of particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the myſteries of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> why cannot the Church now explaine more particularly the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> and any part of Scripture, impugned by Hereticks, and command all Chriſtians to believe the ſame? All the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103652:78"/>new articles are contained in the Apoſtles Creed implicitely, as in that of the <hi>Communion of Saints, Remiſsion of ſinnes, Catholick Church,</hi> &amp;c. or at leaſt in ſome text of Scripture, as Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation in <hi>Chriſts</hi> words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> The petty Miniſters of the Engliſh <hi>Nags-head</hi> Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to make a new Creed of 39. articles, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting againſt the ancient Faith of Chriſtendome, and they admire that the Vicar of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, ſhould warne all Catholicks to beware of their hereſies, and to that end declare in a Symbol of Faith more particularly the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctrine of the Church of God. Away with theſe ſhamefull ſhifts of Hereticks, whoſe laſt excuſe for their Schiſme is, that they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne it, were Roman Catholicks. So were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells once loyall Subjects, and yet that doth not excuſe themſelves, or their adherents, from the guilt of rebellion. With theſe hereticall deviſes are many poore idiots miſled by ungodly and wicked Preachers, who gaine their living and credit by the damnation of ſoules, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Saviour purchaſed at ſo deare a rate.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The laſt thing I propoſed in the title of this Chapter was, that its a greater foppery in Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, then in Catholicks, to deny the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibily in deciding controverſies of Chriſtian Religion. That it is a foppery in both, muſt be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all perſons, that will reflect upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſtian Faith, and the Bookes of holy Scripture. When men believe as Chriſtians, they muſt exclude all manner of doubts and feares of being miſtaken, from the act wherewith they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103652:78"/>they cannot defend themſelves from a new hereſy by onely proteſting againſt it by word of mouth, they muſt deteſt it with their heart and underſtanding, and believe the quite contrary truth. There was never Heretick ſo ſimple as to broach an errour upon his owne ſcore; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pretends Gods Word for its fundation, and backs it with as many texts of Scripture, as Catholicks oppoſe againſt his hereſy. This was the practiſe of <hi>Arrians, Neſtorians,</hi> and all other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hereticks, which Proteſtants doe now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes imitate. If the true meaning of Scripture were as viſible to us, as it is infallible in it ſelfe, no Heretick would make uſe of the words of holy Writ, becauſe his fancy or interpretation would be eaſily diſcerned from the ſenſe which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, at leaſt by combining and comparing one text with another: but experience demonſtrates, that notwithſtanding all combinations of one place of Scripture with another, the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy remaines, and cannot be decided by Scripture alone. To imagine that all which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by Scripture alone, is ſuperfluous, and the beliefe thereof not neceſſary for ſalvation, is to diſpenſe with the myſteries of the Trinity and Incarnation; ſeeing the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Soz. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. Apol. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> and Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> that great Champion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church confuted and condemned the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> not by Scripture alone, but by tradition, and adhearing not onely to the words, but alſo to that ſenſe of Scripture, which that preſent Church had received from the former.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Seeing therefore that controverſies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103652:79"/>Religion muſt be decided by the ſenſe, as well as by the words of Scripture; and that the ſaid ſenſe is more clearly delivered to us by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the teſtimony of the Church, then by the words themſelves in controverted texts; and that Hereticks may endeavour to confound their owne tradition with that of the true Catholick Church (as the <hi>Quartadecimans</hi> did in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating Eaſter;) and that they may invent new hereſies, never thought of in former ages: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, I ſay, that all this is poſſible, the remedy of theſe evills in the Church, cannot be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and truly the remedy is impoſſible (at leaſt at all times, to wit, when generall Councells are not aſſembled) if the Pope be not infallible in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what is hereſy, divine Faith, and Catholick tradition. Such few Catholicks as called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Popes infallibity, excuſed their errour not onely with the infallibility, but alſo with the morall poſſibility of a generall Councell, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a new hereſy would be invented: but they were groſſely miſtaken, as experience doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; and a perpetuall generall Councell was never intended by God, who commandeth the Biſhops and Prelates to have a care of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches which he committed to their charge; a thing not compatible with their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall aſſiſtance in <hi>Constantinople, Trent,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one City, where the Councell is aſſembled. But Proteſtants hitherto have denyed (even the Engliſh Church in the 21. of their 39. articles) that generall Councells arc infallible, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt ſay, that God commanded an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103652:79"/>bidding us beware of new hereſies,<note place="margin">

               <p n="8">8 And though of late ſome of our Nags-head Doctours (contrary to the 21. article of their Creed, and Engliſh Church) acknowledge that generall Councells are infallible in deciding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of Faith, and (to their eternall ſhame, and the infamy of their venerable Mother the Proteſtant Church of England) are now forced to call the 39. <hi>Articles of their Religion</hi> by the name of onely <hi>probable opinions;</hi> yet ſuch a definition or deſcription they give in their printed bookes of a <hi>generall Councell,</hi> with ſo many odde conditions, and ſo inſuperable difficulties, that onely mad men may hope to ſee ſuch a Chriſtian Aſſembly meete, and much leſſe agree in condemning any hereſy, or declaring what is Catholick Doctrine. This new definition of a generall Councell is but a meere put of, to gaine time, that Nags-head er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours may laſt as long as their Miniſters; but they are evidently convinced, and condemned by the abſurdity of their poore ſhift: its a greater fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery to admit of infallibility in an impoſſible Councell, then to admit of a poſſible Councell without infallibility. The firſt is an abſolute <hi>Chimaera,</hi> contrary to the evident light of naturall reaſon: the ſecond ſeemeth onely impoſſible to Chriſtians, that grant there is a Church of God upon earth, and that be hath left meanes in it, to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103652:80"/>end controverſies of Religion with peace and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Catholick Faith.</p>
               <p n="9">9 There cannot be a greater foppery, then to thinke that God inſtituted his Church without poſſibility of obtaining the end or its inſtitution. The end of the Catholick Church is our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by one, and the ſame ſupernaturall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Faith, communicated by preaching and hearing:<note place="margin">

If Profeſtants themſelves judge it a moſt abſurd and deſtructive Tenet in any Commonwealth,<note place="margin">See the late Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Parliament 26.

                  </note> that a murtherer or felon cannot be apprehended, condemned, or puniſhed by any other authority, then that of Parliament, even when it actually ſits; how much more abſurd and deſtructive muſt they grant it would be in the Church, that a murtherer of ſoules, and an Heretick, cannot be declared and condemned by any other authority, or infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, then that of a generall Councell not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſitting, nor likely to be aſſembled in a long time? Doe they imagine that God would inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Church more abſurdly, then themſelves would order a Commonwealth? As in all well
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103652:80"/>ordered Commonwealths there muſt be meanes to ſuppreſſe ſedition at any time, before it comes to be rebellion; ſo in the Church of God, there muſt be meanes to condemne dangerous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and growing hereſies, before they come to ſpread and infect Chriſtian ſoules. If there be no infallible and viſible Judge of controverſies beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des a generall Councell, none will alter his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion untill the generall Councell be gathered, and then it will be too late to apply the remedy. An exteriour acquieſcence doth not change me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s opinions, nor free their minds, and thoughts from heretical errours: none thinkes himſelfe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to forſake his owne opinion, for that of other men, If theirs be noe more then probable. Therefore ſome infallible authority there muſt bee at all times in the Church, whereby men may bee obliged, to condemne even their owne opinions, and errours; and none doth as much as pretend to it, but the Roman Biſhop.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The infallibility of ſome viſible Judge of Controverſies alwayes at hand, eſpecially when generall Councells can not meete conveniently, is ſoe agreable to evident reaſon, and ſoe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the unity of Faith and peace, not onely of the Catholick Church, but alſo of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Commonwealth, that the Proteſtants who were moſt againſt it, are now moſt for it, and wiſh that the Pope, if hee bee not, were as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible as wee pretend. If their wiſh bee rationall (as without doubt it is) wee are to preſume, that God the Author of reaſon, was as rationall in this particular, as they can wiſh. And though
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103652:81"/>it bee ſtrange, how they can imagine, that God can bee unreaſonable in any matter and in one that ſoe much concerned his Church; yet they are convinced by wofull experience, that our belief of the Popes infallibility is as beneficial to Catholicks, as their obſtinacy againſt it, hath beene prejudiciall to Proteſtants, who make Scripture the ground, and warrant of all attempts, and rebellions againſt their Soveraignes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as wee ſubmit our judgements to the ancient, and ſetled interpretation of Gods Word, and when that is not cleare, we conforme our ſelves to the ſentence of the Pope, a very indifferent perſon, and ſupreme Judge in matters of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion; at leaſt he is more unpartiall to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then their owne ſubjects interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by fancy, intereſt, or paſſion.</p>

               <p n="2">2 As the Judge muſt have evidence for his ſentence, and the witneſſe for his teſtimony, ſo muſt the Legiſlatour have evidence that his Law or Statute doth not contradict the Law of God; his legiſlative power muſt be ſubordinate to Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. and Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> penall Statutes, are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently againſt the Law of God and Chriſtian Religion, if we may credit antiquity, and ſtick to the Faith and practiſe of the Church, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes, that went before them, not onely in England, but in all other Chriſtian Kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. No perſons living have any other evidence for the Law of God, and Catholick Religion, but the teſt mony of the immediatly precedent age, confirmed with ſupernaturall ſignes: all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages ſpeake to us by the mouth of the laſt with which we converſed; we muſt cake their
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103652:82"/>word for all the reſt, and for the ſenſe, as well as for the letter of Scripture. The 14. age delivered to the 15. the Roman Catholick Faith, which we now profeſſe; aſſuring that it was the true ſenſe of Scripture, which they had learned from the 13. age, and ſo forth to the Apoſtles. What evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. or his daughter Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to oppoſe againſt the teſtimony of all former ages, confirmed with ſo many miracles, and to make Statutes againſt the knowne and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed Law of God and Chriſtianity? His luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his daughters baſtardy, are the onely evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which Proteſtants can produce for the ground of penall Lawes againſt the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and other points of the Roman Catholick Religion: an excellent foundation of Proteſtant Lawes, Juſtice, and Judicature.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To pronounce ſentence of death, loſſe of goods, or baniſhment, againſt perſons without any prooſe, is rather tyranny then injuſtice. The greateſt crimes (even that of treaſon) require at leaſt one lawfull witneſſe: let Proteſtant produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce but one lawfull witneſſe againſt the Religion of Catholicks, and their ſenſe of Scripture, and we will not murmure againſt their penall Lawes, and rigourous proceedings: Antiquity affords them none, becauſe, though in divers ages, ſome odde men did teſtify ſometimes one errour of theirs, ſometimes another; they were in thoſe very times contradicted by the whole Catholick Church, and declared infamous Impoſtours and Hereticks. In this preſent age no Proteſtants can be lawfull witneſſes for their owne Religion, or
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103652:83"/>againſt ours, becauſe their teſtimony cannot be valid againſt ſo conſtant and univerſall a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we Catholicks have for our Doctrine and ſenſe of Scripture. Its as ridiculous and unjuſt in a Judge, to pronounce ſentence againſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks for their Religion, upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and teſtimony of Proteſtancy, as if he had in open Court condemned men to forfeit their eſtates, and ancient inheritance, upon the word of a mad fellow, that produceth no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to confirme his claime, but interiour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſpirit of coveteouſneſſe and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome obſcure text of the Law appliable to all caſes and ſubjects; for, all the Proteſtant evidence is reduced to the private ſpirit, and the pretended clearneſſe of Scripture. If this be not to deſtroy the foundation of Juſtice, and the forme of Judicature.

This laſt was lawfull in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes, but the practiſe of Proteſtants is unjuſt and wicked, becauſe it deſtroyes Juſtice and the true Religion, confirmed by the publike teſtimony and practiſe of the Chriſtian world, ſince the Apoſtles time to this preſent. If the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Religion were not the true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall Faith, but as new as Proteſtants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, how is it poſſible that in hiſtory there ſhould be no mention made of any perſon that ſuffered as an Heretick, for broaching or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any one point which we now profeſſe? If any Doctrine of ours were judged an hereſy, or a novelty by antiquity, without doubt we had not all eſcaped the rigour of penall Lawes made againſt Hereticks and Noveliſts. I am ſure Proteſtants cannot brag, nor ſay ſo much for their owne Doctrine, many if not all the points whereof have beene condemned as hereſy by the Church in ancient times, and puniſhed as novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Chriſtian Kings and Emperours; which was the onely reaſon that moved the firſt Engliſh Proteſtants to cauſe the young child <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. (when he knew not what he did) to repeale all the Lawes and Statutes that any Chriſtian King of England and the Kingdome had made againſt Hereticks, being convinced that themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and not Catholicks, were comprehended in that number. All who ſuffered perſecution or death for any point of the Roman Religion, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re looked upon by the Catholick Church in all ages, as glorious Confeſſours, and renowned
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103652:84"/>Martyrs. Amongſt the moſt pretious jewells of the Eaſterne Church were accompted ſuch as were put to death for defending the worſhip of Images againſt the <hi>Iconuclaſts,</hi>

The Law ſuppoſed, and did not make the crime, as penall Statutes doe in England, making a crime of Chriſtian Religion. 2. Hereticks are never condemned by the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> without the teſtimony of many lawfull witneſſes, both living and dead: all the ancient Fathers, Councells, and the whole Catholick Church of former ages te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify, that their errours are new, and contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell was ever more evidently convicted of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt his Prince, then Hereticks are by the Inquiſition of hereſy againſt God and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall Church. We Catholicks cannot obtaine ſo faire play at their hands; we are condemned by a new Law, becauſe we are not Hereticks, and our Judges are convicted of the crime they lay to our charge. Surely this is to turne upſide downe Juſtice and Judicature. 3. The Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion medleth not with thoſe who never were Catholicks; but the penall Lawes comprehend them who never were of their Church, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. 4. The Inquiſition condemns no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks to death, but onely declares their hereſy, to the end the faithfull may avoid their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: its true the ſecular power executeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular againſt them, notwitſtanding that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition

Though the Inquiſition were as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and rigorous, as ſome of the ignorant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants pretend, it could be no blemiſh to the Catholick Religion, becauſe it is not an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall practiſe, but limited to <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> at the inſtance of ſecular Princes, who looke upon it as a neceſſary meanes to keepe their Subjects of thoſe Nations in the feare of God, and in awe of their Soveraignes. But the penall Lawes of England are ſpread as farre as their Proteſtant Church and communion. 6. The Inquiſition doth ſeriouſly wiſh and endeavour the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion amendment of Hereticks, employing lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divines to convince them of their errours, and inſtruct them in the way of ſalvation: but the penall Lawes, and the oathes of <hi>ſupremacy, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> and <hi>abjuration,</hi> are like ſo many nets caſt out by Proteſtants, to fiſh eſtates in troubled conſciences; a farre different method from that of the Apoſtles, who were fiſhers of men, and not of eſtates: Proteſtants fiſh for eſtates, though not alwayes with ſucceſſe. In King <hi>Iames</hi> his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103652:85"/>reigne, a <hi>Scot</hi> begged of his Majeſty an Engliſh Catholicks eſtate, to whom he procured that the oath of ſupremacy might be tendered, never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that the Gentleman would take it, or goe to Church, and damne his ſoule to ſave his eſtate: the Gentleman offered the <hi>Scot</hi> a faire compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but nothing would ſatisfy this beggar; if he had not made the Catholick alſo a beggar; who at length reſolved to ſhew himſelfe in the Church; whereupon the <hi>Scot</hi> made him a moſt devout and learned exhortation, diſſuading him from all Proteſtant aſſemblies, often repeating and explaining the words of our Saviour, <hi>What doth it availe a man, if he games all the world by the loſſe of his ſale?</hi> Yet the Engliſh man remained ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and reſolved rather to give his ſoule to the Devill, then his eſtate to a <hi>Scot.</hi> I believe there are many ſuch beggarly Preachers now adayes in England; if they conſider well the text of the Scots Sermon, they may apply it better to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then to Roman Catholicks.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The laſt pretext for perſecuting of Engliſh Catholicks, is the maſſacre and murther of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in Ireland, in the beginning of the late troubles; and this muſt be a preamble to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and Oathes of abjuration. What hath an Engliſh Catholick to doe with an lriſh maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre? I am ſure he doth not thirſt by nature after the bloud of his owne Nation; and his Religion doth neither incline him to murther, or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. That is a privilege of Proteſtancy: we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve a ſetled ſenſe of Scripture, which none can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without breach of Catholick Faith; and we
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103652:86"/>are not Judges of our owne Controverſies, but muſt ſubmit to a third and indifferent perſon. But as for the murthers and maſſacres of Ireland, ſo much and ſo often exaggerated in Proteſtant Pamphlets and Pulpits, I onely ſay, that Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had a greater hand in them, then Catholick Religion, becauſe our Tenets arc contrary to cruelty, and bloudſhead; and though Catholicks may be as guilty of murther as other men, the Religion cannot. Is it not notorious that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in Ireland ſigned a bloudy Petition, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Parliament of England, that all Iriſh who would not goe to Church, might be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, or baniſhed? This was done before the Iriſh Catholicks did ſtirre. But ſuppoſe that in <hi>Vlſter</hi> ſome of the raſcality or kernes (being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated by ſo many and continuall injuries done to them by Proteſtants) had murthered ſome perſons; muſt that reflect upon the Engliſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and all the Iriſh Nation? It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and evident, that the murthers and maſſacres done in Ireland by Proteſtants, exceeded without compariſon thoſe committed by Catholicks, as well in reſpect of their brutiſhneſſe, as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe. Witneſſe their marches about <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Inhabitants were all of Engliſh extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſpoke no other language but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Saxon. There are very few of that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Countrey called <hi>Fingale</hi> left alive, all periſhed, by fire and ſword, being a moſt innocent people, and having nothing I riſhlike in them, but Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion. In the march of the Proteſtant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the County of <hi>Wicklo,</hi> man, woman, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103652:86"/>child was killed; a Gentle woman big with child was hanged at an arch of a bridge, and the poore Catholick that guided the Army, for reward of his ſervice at parting, being commanded to blow into a piſtol, was ſhot therewith into the mouth, though there had beene no murther committed on the Proteſtants in that County. In another march into the ſame ſhire, one Maſter <hi>Comain</hi> an aged Gentleman, who never bore armes, was roaſted alive by one Captaine <hi>Gines;</hi> yea they murthered all that came in their way from within two miles of <hi>Dublin.</hi>

               <p>Doe not divers in theſe very times prove their conſtant affection to the Parliament, by ſhewing their names ſubſcribed to this cruell Petition? Doth not the Mayor, who then was of <hi>London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derry,</hi> an Engliſhman and a Proteſtant, with many others, teſtify, that there was not a drop of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh bloud drawne in the North of Ireland (where the warre begunne) untill the daughter of <hi>O Hara,</hi> an Iriſh Lord, was moſt barbarouſly murthered by Proteſtants? But whoſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be ſatisfied in this particular of Ireland, let him read, amongſt all others, the printed <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance</hi> of the Iriſh Confederate Catholicks, delivered by their Commiſſioners the Lord Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Preſton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Talbot,</hi> the 17. of March 1642. to his Majeſties Commiſſioners at <hi>Trim,</hi> and there he will ſee at large, how the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks deſired that the murthers on both ſides might be puniſhed, and how they were forced to take armes by the wicked practiſes of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Perſons,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> and other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who then governed that Kingdome: the beſt newes you could give the Councell at <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin,</hi> was, that ſuch a Gentleman, or Nobleman, had retired (for feare of being murthered) from
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103652:88"/>his houſe: this was evidence enough to declare him a Rebell, and confiſcate his eſtate; their phraſe was, They had another eſtate to divide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves and their friends; and ſeemed to rejoyce more at the taking armes of one eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, then if all the Kingdome had laid downe armes and ſubmitted. Whatſoever men may ſay in paſſion of the Iriſh warre, its evident that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy had a greater influence upon it, then the Roman Catholick Religion, and therefore ought not to be made the preface, or pretext or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or oathes of <hi>abjuration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 By what hath beene ſaid in this Chapter, it appeareth, that penall Lawes and Oathes againſt the Catholick Roman Religion, deſtroy the ground of Juſtice, and the forme of Judicature, becauſe the witneſſes have no evidence for their teſtimony, the Judges not any for their ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and the Legiſlatour as little for the Law. They are blocks laid in the way for Catholicks to ſtumble at, and occaſions of ſcandall, whereby they muſt damne their ſoules, or looſe their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood. How is it poſſible that any Chriſtian men can drive others into ſuch ſtreights and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities?

And though weake and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Polititians be of a contrary opinion, I am confident they will in time learne by experience, that malicious policy muſt not give the Law to divine Providence, nor their injuſtice prevaile againſt Gods mercies; to whoſe divine Majeſty
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103652:89"/>we Catholicks continuall pray for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our moſt cruell perſecutors, and hope they will be reduced to the way of reaſon and ſalvation, ſooner then they deſerve. But in caſe the Lord be pleaſed to permit them carry on their barbarous perſecution, Catholicks muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, but aſſure themſelves, that then they are moſt favoured by God, when they are moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by Hereticks; and that even in this life, he will, in due time, provide for thoſe who ſuffer for his ſake, and perſevere conſtantly in his Faith and ſervice. But if they will, by taking the oath of objuration, or diſſembling the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, matriculate themſelves in the devils bookes, and blot their names out of the booke of life, they may both in this, and the next, expect to be dealt withall according to their perjury and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious policy; whereby though they may thrive for few and uncertaine dayes, they may be ſure that, even in this world, God will be revenged of their poſterity, and deprive them of that poore inheritance, which their fond and damned pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents purchaſed for them with the oath of abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the loſſe of their ſoules for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Hitherto I have ſpent much time and paper with Polititians, who are either Atheiſts or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants by profeſſion.

There are ſome men who tell lyes with ſo ill a grace, and garb, that you may eaſily perceive how little their thoughts doe agree with their words, and how farre themſelves are from cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting what they would have others believe; their language is ſo ſtuffed with affectation, that you may ſee its rather a piece of artificiall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then a ſinceare and hearty expreſſion. Others are more cunning, and give ſo good a colour to untruths, that they may deceive the wiſeſt men the firſt or ſecond time. This cheating art and eloquence is ſoone learnt, becauſe it requireth little wit, leſſe judgement, and no conſcience; and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103652:90"/>this is the reaſon why it is ſo common. But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be long concealed, it will be very ſoone diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered either by the incoherency of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours ſpeech, or by ſome evidence contradicting his relation, or not compatible with his vaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. They muſt be very ſimple men who are over-reached by the faculty of lying; their firſt credulity may be attributed to want of judgement, but the ſecond argues want of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, with which even fooles abound, and may ſerve their turne, by putting them in minde of the former cheate, and defend them from being fooled the ſecond time by the ſame impoſtour.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If Polititians who make untruths the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their buſineſſes, were to deale with the greateſt fooles, the moſt they might expect, would be to be credited in their firſt or ſecond audience; in the third they may with reaſon feare an afront, or at leaſt that all buſineſſes will be at a ſtand: for, how can a wiſe Prince, or prudent Miniſter of State, build a deſigne upon a mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, whoſe cuſtome and paſſetime is to cheate others. He that is given to lyes, regards not honour, or conſcience, and conſequently will make no ſcruple to embarke his Maſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in a rotten bottome, provided himſelfe may be aſſured to gaine any thing by the naufrage or miſcarriage of the deſigne. This at leaſt will be the ſuſpicion of thoſe with whom he is in treaty, and though they may heare with patience his <hi>harangues,</hi> they will ſuſpend their judgements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their doubts be taken away by ſome other information, and confirmation. And though his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103652:91"/>intelligence ſhould prove true, it will not be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſincere, neither will his credit be any thing encreaſed in their opinions, becauſe cunning lyers tell truth ſometimes, that they may ſeeme to ſpeake it alwayes: therefore the maxime of great Stateſmen is, rather to delay buſineſſes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the loſſe of opportunities, then undertake any upon the word and relation of an impoſtour. Its as impoſſible to profit the Prince or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth by untruths, as it is to foole the wiſeſt men of the world, with whom buſineſſes are dealt: yet this caracter of <hi>Mentiri pro Republica,</hi> hath made the world ſo ſuſpicious of Stateſmens ingenuity, that few of them are believed in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſcourſe. <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. of France aſſured the Hollanders, that <hi>Spinola</hi> would not beſiege a certain Towne of theirs that campana, becauſe <hi>Spinola</hi> told him he would, and was as good as his word, contrary to the King and States expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gained the Towne more by ſpeaking truth, then by fighting. Miniſters of State may conceale the truth, and not ſpeake it to curious and impertinent perſons, but they ought not to conceale it by ſpeaking untruths.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Vaine men are moſt given to lyes of any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tell untruths not onely to others, but to themſelves; to others by words, and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their fond conceits of their owne abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and parts: whence it proceeds, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect not upon the incoherency of their words, becauſe having deceived themſelves by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary opinion of themſelves and of their own judgement, they are confident of deceiving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103652:91"/>out the leaſt hazard of being caught in a lye, the onely thing that makes a lyar circumſpect. A vaine man doth imagine, that wiſe and ſober men are as much taken with flatteries, as he is with flattering himſelf; and therefore in all occaſions doth practiſe his paraſiticall art ſo plainly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, that they who are leaſt concerned, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbeare to bluſh, and wiſh themſelves farre enough from ſo ungratefull and injurious an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour; yet he apprehends non injury done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth to others, what he would have done to himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 A man who miſtakes himſelfe ſo groſſely, muſt needs be miſtaken in others, and in buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for which he is as unfit, as he imagineth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe proper. Deſignes upon others muſt be firſt applyed to our ſelves; we muſt conſider what our ſelves would doe to prevent or quaſh them, in caſe they had come to our knowledge, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly judge of our enemies; not contemne their wit, or valour, as vaine men doe all others compared with themſelves. The onely way the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore to effect a deſigne, is to keepe it ſecret, and a vaine man is as little maſter of his thoughts and of a ſecrecy, as of his tongue. He muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime to all the world, how much he is truſted, and to the end none may doubt of it, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his truſt, and reveale the ſecrecy (which is the life of buſineſſes) to any that will heare him, and ſeeme to congratulate and applaude his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with his Prince, or others, to whom he is employed. But if himſelfe doth undertake to ſet a deſigne afoot, he will be ſo ſet upon vaine ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103652:92"/>that there will be as little roome for the practicall part, as there was for <hi>Archimedes</hi> to ſtand in, when he undertooke to demonſtrate, that he could move the earth. Vaine men are great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers, and promiſe to move both heaven and earth, make ſtirres and revolutions upon Sea and Land; but when it comes to the puſh, they are as farre from performance, as <hi>Archimedes</hi> was from turning the earth upſide downe.</p>
               <p n="5">5 By this it appeares how neceſſary it is for Princes to make choice of ſtayed, ſober, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere men to doe their buſineſſes: the beſt letter of credence is the employed perſons, truth, and integrity; without which nothing will be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; nothing being more odious, then a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, lying, and vaine man; to croſſe him, his Maſters buſineſſe may be croſſed; ſilence and delayes will be his anſwer, which is a ſignificant language in wiſe and civill Courts; though vaine men are not capable of underſtanding any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion however ſo cleare that may ſeeme to call in queſtion their owne favour and ſucceſſe, and will rather ſtrive againſt the Courts inclination, then acknowledge that themſelves can be ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull or miſtruſted. Wiſe men will be loath to taxe the Miniſter of another Prince of any fault, though the proofe were evident: therefore the Prince who employed him, muſt not take for granted, that others are ſatisfied of his truth &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, becauſe they do not declare their mindes in words: there is no language better underſtood amongſt Stateſmen, then the progreſſe of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe you propoſe; if it goeth on roundly, they
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103652:92"/>underſtand you; if there be rubs &amp; ſtops, you may underſtand them if you pleaſe, and may aſſure your ſelfe, that there is ſomething amiſſe either in the buſineſſe, or in the perſon that followeth it: and if the buſineſſe be as advantagious to the Court as is pretended, and yet is not advanced; the perſon who treateth it, cannot be gratefull to the Miniſters: and this is the practiſe and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of wiſe Stateſmen and civill Conrtiours, as you may ſee in <hi>Antonio Perez</hi> his Letters, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his eſcape into France, became a Mediatour in that Court for a Friend; but by the delayes and civill language of the Miniſters, underſtood their meaning, as one who had practiſed the ſame art in the Court of Spaine. Wherefore let Polititians perſwade thcmſelves, that truth and plaine dealing is not ſo contrary to policy and buſineſſes, as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <hi>Sir Politicks would be,</hi> doe vainly imagine.

               <argument>
                  <p>That it is impoſsible to be a wiſe States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and effect buſineſſes, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall honeſty; and that it is most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for a Prince to have Councellours that are diſhoneſt men.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>KNavery</hi> now adayes hath gained ſo much credit in Courts, and amongſt weake Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103652:93"/>that you doe a man an injury (in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) if you call him an <hi>honeſt man:</hi> they thinke that to be honeſt, or to be a foole, are <hi>ſynonimas,</hi> or the ſame thing. A diſhoneſt man can neither be truſted at home nor abroad, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can be no Stateſman; forreigne Princes will have nothing to doe with him, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects leſſe, if they can have acceſſe to their Prince without him. Its impoſſible for him to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit honeſty; if he be not really honeſt, it will be ſoone diſcovered, becauſe honeſty conſiſts more in deeds, then in words, and though wicked thoughts may be concealed by good language, actions cannot, ſeeing they muſt appeare and be cenſured by all the world according to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The beſt part of <hi>Policy</hi> conſiſts in perſwading others to what you ayme at; and eloquence of words will not doe, when deeds are contrary. So that it is as impoſſible for one to be a wiſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititian without morall honeſty, as it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the wickedneſſe of viſible actions, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no good interpretation; or to perſwade men that nothing is intended by diſhoneſt and deſtructive wayes, but honeſt and plaine dealing. If all the reſt of the world were blinde fooles, diſhoneſt men might paſſe amongſt them for wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Polititians.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What prejudice ſuch men drawes upon Princes that follow their advice, though not their example, is obvious to every Chriſtian that will conſider, how much Gods Providence is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in croſſing wicked counsels and deſignes. But becauſe we are to deale now with perſons that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103652:93"/>laugh at God and his Providence, as at <hi>ſkarcrowes,</hi> whereby ſimple folkes are frighted out of their wits and intereſt, we muſt wave that argument, and ſpeake to fooles in their owne language, that is, onely of temporall motives and humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. A diſhoneſt man is alwayes buſied with wicked plots, and employes his creatures (who are as pernicious as himſelfe) in all places of gaine, truſt, and honour: all men of parts and merits are excluded, becauſe they ſcorne to be ſpyes, pimps, or ſlaves to diſhoneſt Councellours, or to ſuch as are raiſed from the durt by their favour, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the Commonwealth. There is nothing that the multitude doth more reſent, then to ſee worthy and vertuous men neglected, becauſe though men hate vertue in themſelves, they love it in others; beſides, <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> are the two wings wherewith perſons of lowe diſcent hope to be raiſed to any height and preferment, which if they ſee clipt in others, they will deſpaire to be ſupported by them, and will declare to all men with whom they converſe, how little they are to expect from thoſe, whoſe intereſt is grounded upon vice, and diſhoneſt proceedings. From this common diſcontent, managed by ſome factious and politick head, the Subjects come many times to rebel againſt his Prince, for not puniſhing or baniſhing his evill Councellours; and theſe, who looke more upon their owne preſervation, then the Prince his ſafety or honour, engage him more and more in their quarell, by perſwading him, that to Rebells nothing muſt be granted; who at length get all by force, with the ruine of their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103652:94"/>Soveraigne and his poſterity. All this you may ſee verified in the life of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second King of England.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But in caſe the quite contrary way be taken, and that the Subjects (to comply with perverſe inclinations, and thoſe who are in power) ſtrive who ſhall be moſt wicked, from thence muſt greater danger ariſe to the Prince, then from any other emulation, or diſcontent. Vertuous men are few, and conſequently the Prince may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty finde them employments: but if vice be rewarded, he will not finde in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wherewith to content half the number of diſhoneſt pretenders; and to ſatisfie ſome few of them, is to diſguſt all the reſt, who being men of as little honour as conſcience, will make uſe of their number and power, to obtaine what they could not by favour, and will clime up to the height of their ambition by force and wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. This is the reaſon why Princes ought to eſteeme and reward vertue, and diſcountenance vice, and why none ought to be of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whoſe integrity is not notorious to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; for, how can a Prince diſcountenance vice, if his Favourits be vicious and diſhoneſt perſons? Their ill example may be his ruine, becauſe all men who deſire to be preferred, will proſtitute their conſciences to the Favourits will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and neglect his Maſter; and when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourit hath gained the greateſt part of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to his owne devotion, perhaps he will plot ſomething againſt the Soveraignes perſon, and promote to the royall Throne ſome of his owne
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103652:94"/>relations. A Prince cannot be too ſuſpicious and jealous of diſhoneſt Councellours; the greateſt tye of fidelity being conſcience, they who have none muſt prove diſloyall, whenſoever it ſtands with their conveniency. Therefore its moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and want of true Policy in Princes, to truſt themſelves or their affaires in the hands of ſuch men: for, though it be their intereſt this day to be faithfull to their King, it may be the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to morrowe; I am ſure it can never be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to ſtick to them, or owne their diſhoneſt proceedings. The intereſt of Kings lyeth in the affection of his Subjects, and its impoſſible they ſhould affect a King, who not onely protects, but ownes manifeſt injuſtices. Subjects are men, and as apt to reſent and revenge injuries, as the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. He muſt handle them very gently, and not expoſe them to the contempt or tyranny of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Miniſters; for, though they may have patience for a time, at length they may growe furious, and he will finde himſelfe miſtaken in their temper, when it is too late to diſmiſſe or puniſh thoſe who occaſioned their diſtempers.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Amongſt all Princes ruined by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Miniſters, none is more to be pittied then <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. of England, becauſe he could as little depoſe as chooſe his Counſellours, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his minority. It is the opinion of moſt Writers, that <hi>Dudley</hi> Duque of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> after beheading <hi>Seamour</hi> the Protectour, did poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the King, to the end his ſonne <hi>Guilford,</hi> who married the Lady <hi>Iane Gray,</hi> might, in her right, be King, and himſelfe in the right and reigne of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103652:95"/>his ſonne, governe England, excluding Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Queene of Scots. I doe not thinke that any hiſtory can give teſtimony of more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt Counſellours in one time, and in one Kingdome, then we read of in this poore childs reigne. <hi>Seamour</hi> himſelfe violated his oath and promiſe given to <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. that no new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould be brought into England during the Kings minority. Afterwards he cauſed his owne brother to be beheaded. The Duque of <hi>Northumberland</hi> plotted the Kings death, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his Faith, which at length upon the ſcaffold he profeſſed, dying a Roman Catholick, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the Nation to ſticke to that Religion. But what I deſire Princes ſhould reflect upon, is, how dangerous it is for them, to have Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours void of all Religion and conſcience. A man would thinke that <hi>Dudley</hi> could have no other intereſt, but that of King <hi>Edward,</hi> whom he ruled together with the Kingdome; and yet we ſee how farre he went to fetch a contrary intereſt, and by what wicked and diſhoneſt wayes. There is no intereſt remote, or too farre from one of a large conſcience, if he be perſwaded its more for his purpoſe, then the preſent which he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth. Let Princes therefore countenance vertue, and baniſh vice from their Courts and Counſells, if they have any care of their owne intereſt and ſecurity. But now let us ſee</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How neceſſary it is for a Stateſman to be a man of honour, and of his word; and how great a difference there is betweene <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Craft?</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 ALl Stateſmen muſt be Gentlemen in their actions. They muſt ſhunne as much meane wayes in themſelves, as they muſt ſeeme not to diſlike of them in other meane perſons, whom they employe or entertaine as neceſſary and baſe inſtruments. They muſt countenance ſpyes, but ſcorne to be ſpyes themſelves. The maxime of a Stateſman muſt be, not to betray any man that confides in him; for, the food of Policy is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and knowledge of buſineſſes, which none will give that is afraid of being betrayed. A man may be faithfull to his Prince, without being a Traitour to his Subjects, or any other; and the favour of a Miniſter with his Prince, muſt not be grounded upon information of other mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but upon his owne ſervices, ſtrength of judgement, and dexterity of managing affaires. He who creeps into favour by telling tales, and ſuch meane wayes, is rather a petty ſpy and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, then a wiſe Stateſman. I have knowne a great Miniſter of State, who told a Gentleman that deſired to be adviſed by him, he would helpe him in what he could, but warned him before
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103652:96"/>hand, that he would make uſe of any thing he heard for his Maſters ſervice; and therefore bid him conſider, whether it was for his purpoſe to communicate unto him any ſecrecy. This was honourable and plaine dealing; he would ſerve his King, and not betray others: and yet this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State is knowne to be as faithfull to his Maſter, as ever Subject was to Prince, having loſt for his ſervice as great an eſtate, as any Subject in our parts of Chriſtendome doth poſſeſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There are ſome perſons that place the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Polititian, in being a Favourite of that faction which actually beareth ſway: they thinke it wiſdome (though not worth) to change their friends as often as theſe doe their fortune, and (which is worſe) to become enemies or thoſe who raiſed them from nothing, becauſe its ſo neceſſary to humour the preſent power. Such cut-purſes and cut-throates are the infamy of Courts, and the dregs of Commonwealths. No wiſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſman can truſt them, becauſe if the Prince doth but frowne at him, he may be ſure to receive a kick from ſo mercenary and ungratefull fellowes, who may be called crafty companions, but no wiſe Polititians. Beaſts may be crafty, but not wiſe or politick: craft, even in men, requires but little wit, or policy: there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a crafty foole, and a wiſe Polititian. Theſe crafty fooles, or Court ſpyes, have no leſſe worth in them, then many brute beaſts, that preſerve a gratefull memory to their benefactours; and ſhew as little judgement as honour, in accommodating themſelves to the times in ſo ſhameleſſe a manner.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103652:96"/>A man is not bound in conſcience, or honour, to ſtrive obſtinatly for his Friend againſt the torrent of a Court, and the violence of a wilfull Prince, but he is obliged not to ſide with his enemies. It is no raſh judgement to thinke, that he who becomes an enemy to his Friend onely upon the ſcore of the preſent power, or prevailing faction, will doe the ſame to his Prince, if ever he be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerd by any that will admit of ſuch infamous Paraſits into his favour. Such meane Creatures are more fit for goales then Courts, for footmen then friends, for ſpies then ſervants, and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous pimps, then for wiſe Stateſmen.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Craft</hi> doe not onely differ by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diverſity of the judgements and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the perſons, but alſo doe require diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent objects; <hi>policy</hi> being ordained for great and weighty affaires, and <hi>craft</hi> onely for petty tricks and poore devices. Its as abſurd to ſee a Stateſman buſy himſelfe about meane and little matters as it is to ſee an Ape ſit amongſt Counſellours of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, or a crafty foole debate matters of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. Though the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did pardon cutpurſes and thieves, when they committed the crime with exquiſite craft, yet they never thought fit to make them Counſellours of the Commonwealth, knowing full well the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that there is betweene craft and Policy: a man may be wary and circumſpect as to his own particular concerns, and yet be very unfit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne a Kingdome or Commonwealth, the firſt proceeds from ſelfelove; the ſecond requires great judgement; and though no man of great
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103652:97"/>judgement hates himſelfe, yet many love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that have but little judgement, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may be fit to have a care of their owne intereſt, but not to direct the affaires of Princes and Kingdomes.</p>
               <p n="4">4 A Stateſman muſt alſo be a man of his word, that is, he muſt performe whatſoever he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, either in publike or private. To be a man of word, is more then not to ſpeake untruths, or tell lyes; for, one may not performe what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and yet not tell a lye, becauſe when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, he intended to performe, and ſpoke not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his minde, which he afterwards changed. But a Stateſman muſt ſtand as much upon pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall performance of his promiſe, as a Merchant upon punctuall payment of his bills; both live and traffike upon credit, if that be loſt, none will deale with either. The beſt way to keepe a mans word, is, not to engage it in any thing, which he is not ſure to performe, and conſequently not to promiſe what depends upon the will and pleaſure of the Prince, without acquainting him not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the matter, but alſo with the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe one circumſtance may alter the caſe, and give occaſion to diſlike the whole buſineſſe. It is a poore come of, in a Miniſter of State, to ſay, Its true I promiſed ſuch a thing, but I cannot command my Maſter, nor performe without his allowance. This lookes like a cheate, and muſt be farre from the mouth and thoughts of a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe profeſſion is to deale warily, but not to cozen. He ought to have acquainted his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with the buſineſſe, before it was concluded,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103652:97"/>and not bring his honour in queſtion, by conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him a pupill, ſeeing his Miniſter durſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch matters without his conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

The Prince his word is engaged in the promiſe of his chiefe Miniſter, at leaſt his honour is tainted by the nonperformance, he muſt either make good his Miniſters word, or acknowledge that himſelfe was but a cifer when his Miniſter concluded the buſineſſe; ſo that not onely for his owne, but for for his Maſters ſake, the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt be a man of his word, and punctuall in performing.</p>
               <p n="5">5 There is not any thing that puts a Prince or Miniſter of State in greater danger and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then nonperformance; becauſe it is a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation of the right they have to be performed withall by others: it is the ground of a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt their credit and reputation, which is the greateſt treaſure and beſt ſupport of Princes, who cannot alwayes be furniſhed with money for their Armies, Navies, and other occaſions; therefore they muſt borrowe it from their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or friends, who will looke upon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Monarch as upon a Bankropt, if he be not punctuall in making good his word and promiſe. And truly when Princes doe not performe, it is to be ſuppoſed they are not able, becauſe onely an impoſſibility can force them to omit a thing ſo neceſſary for their preſervation and reputation, the loſſe of which is the greateſt blow that a Monarchy or Commonwealth can receive.

A Prince that maketh uſe of odious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, doth declare warre againſt his owne Subjects, or at leaſt giveth them occaſion to declare warre againſt himſelfe. The greateſt difficulty that Subjects finde in their ſubjection, is to obey the Kings Miniſters: when himſelfe commands, they take it for an honour; but when a fellow Subject commands, though he doth it in the Kings name and by his authority, they can hardly digeſt that pill, becauſe that which ſhould temper and ſweeten it, makes it more ungratefull, to wit, the Kings authority, which in a Subject is as bitter as gale, though in himſelf it be moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: the more Kingly a Subject lookes, the more are the people offended with his ſight and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; he is an object of envy, not of love.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:103652:98"/>
               <p n="2">2 And the reaſon of this antipathy is, becauſe he who repreſents the Kings perſon, doth not command with the Kings mouth, nor with the Kings will, but with his owne; in reality its he that commands, not the King, though he tells you the contrary, and that his Majeſty doth morally ſpeake and command in him: few Subjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this diſtinction and morality; they ſee the King is not preſent &amp; that one of their owne <hi>Camerades</hi> commands them as abſolutely as their Soveraigne; this is all they ſee and feele: other formalities and moralities are but fictions of the Law, whereby we are commanded to imagine that the King ſpeaketh, when his Miniſter utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any thing in his Majeſties name: men are ſlow in feigning or imagining any thing to their owne diſadvantage, or contrary to their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and nothing is more contrary to humane nature, then to acknowledge ſuperiority in our equalls; wherefore there is great difficulty in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying a Subject, becauſe we are evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he is our equall, and a Subject, though he commands like our King and Superiour; and we are more inclined to feigne and imagine, that he is unworthy of the Kings authority, then that he ought to be endowed with ſo great a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; at leaſt we wiſh he were not, and our wiſhes are the beſt interpreters of our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And though many times the perſon that commands us be capable of the greateſt truſt, yet they who are commanded, are apter to imagine, that he betrayeth it, or at leaſt exceedeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or inſtructions, then they are to obey or
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103652:99"/>to imagine that the King hath as great a hand in the command as is pretended.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Men being ſo apt of their owne nature to take fire of ſedition, when they are commanded of their equalls, againſt whom they have no other averſion, or quarell, but his authority, and the Prince his favour; into what flames of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion may we preſume will they breake forth, when their naturall inclinations are fomented by the paſſions of contempt and hatred againſt the Prince his Officer or Counſellour, for his vices or misfortunes? They will imagine that he is as mindfull, as themſelves are fearfull of revenge, and will attribute his commands more to paſſion, then to any zeale of his Maſters ſervice, or good of the Commonwealth. And in caſe it be evident that nothing is done without the Prince his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and warrant, they will perſwade themſelves that the ground of the Prince his warrant, is their Enemies information, if not his importunity to annihilate all thoſe who are not his Creatures. When he promotes any of his owne relations, however ſo well deſerving, he is looked upon as partiall, unjuſt, and unfit for the government. If he keepes a great traine, he is proud; if given to hoſpitality or civill converſation, he ſtrives to make himſelfe popular, and is a dangerous man; all his words and actions are miſinterpreted, or not underſtood, becauſe he is hated by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the people, who are the ſupreme Judges, or rather Creatours of a good and ill fame; and good fame is as neceſſary for a Miniſter of State, as policy; the want of it in a Counſellour is more
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103652:99"/>dangerous to the Prince, then the want of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or experience: this may be ſupplied by the Prince his owne judgement, and application to buſineſſes; but the ill name and reputation of a Miniſter cannot be helped by the Prince his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nay rather his owne fame and judgement will be called in queſtion, for putting his affaires into the hands of a perſon infamous in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his people, or at leaſt unfortunate in his deſignes.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Sometimes it may happen, that really the Prince his Miniſter, or Counſellour, is injured by the opinion of the world, and that the people have no other crime to lay to his charge, but their owne hatred: therefore Princes doe often ſtrive againſt the multitude, to maintaine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of their Officers againſt ſo unreaſonable a paſſion. This argues in the Prince a very good nature and an inclination to Juſtice, and is much to be commended, if what he deſires can be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: yet its a very hard taske, becauſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt innocency once condemned by the verdict of the people, will hardly have the ſentence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, though never ſo unjuſt: the ſame paſſion of hatred that prevailed againſt ſo cleare inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, doth make men obſtinate in adhearing to the falſe judgements they have once given of a good Miniſters abilities or actions. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is compared to a beaſt, it may be tamed, but never by reaſon perſwaded to alter their fancy, or opinion once conceived and grounded upon paſſion, whereby the major part are led. The wiſdome of a politick Prince doth not conſiſt in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103652:100"/>making the multitude wiſe, that being a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, it conſiſteth in applying his owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to direct their humours by reaſon, in due times and occaſions. The art of riding the great horſe, requires wit and judgement in the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but not in the horſe; it doth not conſiſt in communicating wit or judgement to the horſe, but in applying with dexterity his owne art to the beaſts humour. A wiſe Prince muſt humour the multitude, as men humour beaſts which they teach or tame, he muſt not ſtrive to make them wiſe and reaſonable, though they muſt be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by wiſdom &amp; reaſon. They are as uncapable of altering a popular errour and common hatred againſt a Counſellour or Miniſter of State, as old mules are of leaving of their jadiſh tricks. The Prince muſt have patience, and diſſemble with this humorſome beaſt, the <hi>multitude,</hi> and governe them by Miniſters that are not odious, but grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them; if not, they may play him a jadiſh trick, and kick at him, for the hatred they beare to his Miniſter. The onely way for the Prince to he rid of this danger and trouble, is, to make choice of ſo good and vertuous Miniſters, that no calumny can prejudice their fame, nor hatred finde matter to carp at in their actions. So that when all comes to all, we ſee that honeſty and integrity is the ground of policy, and that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without vertue in a Miniſter of State, is of moſt dangerous conſequence to his Prince. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore in my opinion its an evident proofe of wiſdome, and a laudable cuſtome in Princes, to make uſe of Biſhops and Clergymen in their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103652:100"/>Counſells, becauſe its preſumed they are more then ordinarily vertuous. But ſeeing many are of a contrary ſenſe, I will examine it, and prove</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That it is great wiſdome and policy in Princes, to make uſe of Clergymen in State affaires.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 THat it hath beene the continuall practiſe amongſt the Jewes, to let the Prieſts ſhare in the government of the Commonwealth, is evident by many examples in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, you will not read of one age, wherein the Clergy have not had their heads and hands in politick affaires, by order of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and conſent of the people. To exclude them from this cuſtome and practiſe, becauſe ſome of them made not as good uſe thereof as they ought, is an argument more familiar to ſeculars, then advantagious; fewer Churchmen then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars have abuſed their power, or betrayed their truſt; nay it hath beene as rare amongſt them, as ordinary amongſt ſeculars, to make ill uſe of their Kings favour and intereſt, and yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars doe not thinke it reaſonable, that all them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould be excluded by the Princes, or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from the government of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, though ſome of them have beene more miſtaken, and are more ſubject to erre in that art, then the Clergy: their argument therefore
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103652:101"/>may be with more force retorted againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Polititians are Joyners by their trade, their art conſiſts in joyning the common good with the intereſt of the Prince. It muſt be a cleare judgement that will not confound theſe two things, and he muſt be no leſſe vertuous, then wary, that will not incline more to one ſide, then to the other. Seculars are pleaſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge more vertue in Churchmen, then in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they doubt much of their judgements. If ſtudy of ſciences and knowledge of what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in former ages, doth perfect mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Churchmen have the advantage of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in judging of affaires, who have not ſo much time to ſpare from their paſſetimes, nor ſo great an inclination and obligation to learne, as the Clergy. But ſeculars, though they were as learned as Churchmen, cannot apply themſelves ſo ſeriouſly to the ſtudy of the common good, becauſe they have much more to conſider in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and domeſtick affaires; they muſt provide for their wife, and diſpoſe of their children. Yet in caſe they ſhould ſpend but little time in ſo neare a concernment, they cannot deny, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and Commonwealth runne a hazard in truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with publick offices and revenues, out of which they will be very apt to provide por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their daughters, and employments for their ſonnes: Clergymen are neither troubled themſelves, nor trouble the Commonwealth with ſuch burthen, and conſequently are more fit then ſeculars to manage the publick affaires. A
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103652:101"/>Churchman perhaps may endeavour to promote his Nephew, but there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the affection of a Father and of an Uncle.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The obligation and cuſtome which Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have, to ſpend more houres in their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then ſeculars, doth give more advantage by perfecting their mindes, then it doth prejudice by taking up their time; not ouely becauſe with God no time is loſt, who recompenſeth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly by his grace and illuſtrations, other ſtudies and thoughts; but alſo becauſe true policy muſt direct all things with ſubordination to Gods Law, and the more we meditate therein, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Polititians we are. Yet Churchmen after complying with their devotions, haue more time to conſider of affaires, then ſeculars, who are more in the Taverne then in the Church, and frequent other paſſetimes when Churchmen are in their ſtudies.</p>
               <p n="4">4 All mankinde is ſo much concerned in the government of Commonwealths, that it is not improper for the moſt retired of the Clergy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes to appeare in publick affaires. We read of <hi>Monks</hi> that came along from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> to treate with Emperours about matters of great concernment: <hi>Hermits</hi> have returned to the world from the deſarts, when they judged it neceſſary for the common good. Suppoſe a man were buried alive in a <hi>grot</hi> under the walls of a Towne, to the end he might ſhunne humane converſation; if he doth heare the Enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the wall, he is bound in conſcience to leave his retirement, and give notice of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103652:102"/>danger. When a houſe is a fire, they who are next, muſt runne to quench it. There is no profeſſion ſo retired, or ſo contrary to the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of State affaires that can excuſe men from appearing in publick, when they are concerned in the good of a Nation, or Religion, eſpecially if they be next in truſt of a Treaty, or knowledge of a danger. Much leſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>n men ſeparated from the world, deny acceſſe to others, who demand their advice in doubtfull and intricate matters of State, wherein conſcience may runne a hazard. Princes and Counſellours conſult their Confeſſours in Cloiſters, and thinke them more apt to judge of worldly affaires, then others that live and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate in the world. It is no diſparagement for that grave and ſage Counſell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that the Kings Confeſſour hath a place and vote amongſt them; he may be a witneſſe that nothing is reſolved, which is not agreable to Chriſtian and Catholick principles; his profeſſion is not contrary to an office out of which ſo much good may be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to others. Biſhops are Counſellours in <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> and all other Catholick Countries, and <hi>Abbots,</hi> who profeſſe a moſt retired life, came from their Cloiſters and Cells to ſit in Parliament, when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion did flouriſh moſt in England; and the ſame is practiſed to this day in other Nations, with as great ſatisfaction of the Prince, as benefit to the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="5">5 There is nothing more neceſſary for a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſman, then ſecrecy, whereof Churchmen give continually evident proofes in hearing Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Seculars may be ſecret, but the world hath
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103652:102"/>not ſo much reaſon to believe it, ſeeing ſo many deſignes and great buſineſſes miſcarry for want of ſecrecy, which I never heard laid to the charge of a Clergyman that was truſted in a buſineſſe of State. Its a received maxime amongſt ſeculars, that women are beſt informers, and that they are made acquainted with whatſoever is debated in Counſells or Aſſemblies. Fond huſbands thinke they doe not love their wives, if they conceale any thing from their knowledge, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that of their Goſſips. Its thought the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Nation is more inclined to be adviſed by women, then any other; but without doubt it is of late, ſince women ruled the Church, and were made Popes, diſpenſed with invalid Ordinations, and by impoſition of hands made Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But ſeeing no man will truſt his wife with his owne conſcience and confeſſion, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he ought not to impart to her the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of others. At leaſt the Catholick Clergy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuſpected to conſult with their wives the ſecrecy of Princes, becauſe they have none: but for the Proteſtant Miniſters behaviour in this particular, I will not ſweare, being (as I heare) more fond of their wives, then any others, and having notoriouſly betrayed ſecrets communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them in confeſſion, as you may read of <hi>Scory</hi> the Miniſter, who betrayed the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time; and in our dayes the caſe of poore Captain <hi>Hinde</hi> was much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who ſome few yeares ſince being accuſed of murther,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Hindes</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable caſe.</note> denyed it confidently, there being no legall proofe. But perſwaded by a Miniſter of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103652:103"/>Engliſh Proteſtant Church, that the Judge was reſolved to hang him, and that he had aboundant proofe, he exhorted the poore man to confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, according to the cuſtome or Common-prayer men, and Church or England, whereof both were Members. Maſter <hi>Hinde</hi> told the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in confeſſion, that he had killed one of his owne Camerades, and he promiſed to viſit and comfort his penitent the next day; but feigning himſelfe ſick, he ſent another Miniſter of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Church alſo, and deſired Maſter <hi>Hinde</hi> to deale as confidently with him, as he had done the day before with himſelfe; which the poore Gentleman did, imparting likewiſe to him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion what he had told the day before to his Brother in the Lord: and theſe two Miniſters were the onely witneſſes that proved Maſter <hi>Hindes</hi> murther, whereof they had no other knowledge, but what he told them in cofeſſion: whereupon ſentence of death was pronounced againſt him by Judge <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and executed at <hi>Worceſter.</hi> He reflected upon the Religion of his Confeſſours and witneſſes, and reſolved to chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge his owne, concluding, that it could not be the true one which alloweth ſuch treacherous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and obligeth men to reveale Sacramentall confeſſions, making it Gunpouder treaſon, not to betray God and the truſt which he repoſeth in the Miniſters of his holy Sacraments, as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in <hi>Garnets</hi> caſe. Maſter <hi>Hinde</hi> therefore ſent for a Prieſt, and was reconciled to the Roman Catholick Church; and I hope is ſaved, not by virtue, but by the occaſion of his Proteſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103652:103"/>whereof I truſt in God himſelfe will not be the laſt that will make good uſe for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoules, by forſaking ſo falſe a Church and ſo treacherous Clergy, whereby mens lives are entrapt, and their ſinnes not abſolved. By this and other examples its manifeſt, that Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are as unfit to be Counſellours as Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and that the Catholick Prieſts, who will rather dye then betray a ſecrecy, have a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſeculars as to this ſo neceſſary a part of a Stateſman.</p>
               <p n="6">6 We ſee alſo how men beſotted with drink, and bewitched by bribes, are ſubject to betray their truſt in greateſt ſecrecies; and I believe it will not be hard to finde (at leaſt in this our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Climat, where this kinde of <hi>debauch</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not onely for a remedy of melancholy, but a point of gallantry) Lay Polititians proceed now and then to ſuch exceſſe, as to eaſe not onely their ſtomachs, but hearts, to the great diſtemper of the Commonwealth. As for bribes, thoſe who have moſt expenſes, and moſt to provide for, and ſuffer leſſe infamy, if diſcovered, and ordinarily are leſſe provided with grace to reſiſt, cannot chooſe but be more lyable to the danger of this temptation, as it appeares by theſe circumſtances, and much more by too frequent and knowne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Theſe, amongſt many others, are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why Catholick Princes make ſo frequent uſe of the Roman Clergy.

               <p n="8">8 Now is it time to put an end to this Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, and exhort my Polititian 1. to reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Religion, if he hath none. 2. To conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how all Religions pretending to reforme the Roman, are but humane and fond inventions, grounded upon falſe intereſt, tranſitory pleaſure, and mad fancies, contrary to the rules of ſound Policy. 3. How the Roman Catholick Religion cannot be an invention of men, having ſo many evidences of ſupernaturall ſignes and power, to confirme its Doctrine. 4. In caſe our Polititian will neither believe in God nor Catholick Church, let him conſider, that the greateſt and moſt effectuall engine to worke his owne inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, is truth, morall vertue, and honour. In the
